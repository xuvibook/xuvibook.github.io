## FOREWORD

### I

A third of a century has now passed since C. P. Snow
brought to wider awareness a crisis simmering just below
the surface of Western cultural life. In his Rede lectures
at Cambridge University Snow spoke of “two cultures”
existing side by side within one culture, yet separated by
a yawning gulf. Not only was communication very lim-
ited between the groups Snow chose to characterize—the
scientists and the literary intellectuals—but a somewhat
hostile mood even existed. Have we lost even the pretense
of a common culture? This was the question Snow placed
before the Western world.

When Snow raised this question, the belief in contin-
ued progress through the consequent application of sci-
ence and technology to society’s problems and needs was
still borne with tremendous optimism. Viewed from the
perspective of the 1990s, the polarization he was pointing
to seems barely to have surfaced at the time he spoke. To-
day this gulf is evident everywhere—but in much greater


diversity and at many different levels: from multicultur-
alism to postmodernity. Many additional “cultures” have
since raised their voices in the great debate about the fu-
ture of humanity.

A major impetus in this direction was given in the early
sixties by Thomas Kuhn’s book The Structure of Scien-
tific Revolutions. In what is probably the most widely dis-
cussed analysis of the scientific endeavor in the second
half of this century, Kuhn makes evident the presupposi-
tions that underlie every form of scientific activity. Scien-
tific  “truths,”  supposedly  “objective”  in  nature,  were
shown to be the reflection of a background of shared as-
sumptions dominant in that scientific community. Kuhn
called this framework of presuppositions a “paradigm.”
When a paradigm changes, so does the appearance of the
world for those sharing that viewpoint.

What Kuhn formulated in the context of modern science
has, together with its wider implications for nonscientific
discourse, shaken the rationalistic foundations of Western
society  at  the  end  of  this  century.  The  suspicion  has
emerged that all thought and belief systems are merely so-
cial constructions. Sometimes known as our “postmodern
condition,” this situation is characterized by a plurality of
viewpoints—not  just  Snow’s  two  cultures—where  vary-
ing  groups  are  often  unable  to  communicate  with  each
other because of the different “languages” they speak. Not
only has the legitimacy of scientific knowledge as the pri-
mary source of “objective” understanding been called into
question, but also the possibility of making valid universal
statements about the nature of anything.


Whereas the latter discussion has taken place primar-
ily at an academic level, the crisis of “modernism” has
become evident throughout Western society. Be it in eco-
nomics,  in  education,  in  environmental  or  in  social  is-
sues, we find ourselves at the dawn of a new millennium
in the midst of a multifaceted reconsideration of our cul-
tural foundations. Like it or not, the limits of reductive
natural  science  and  of  the  narrow  fixation  on  outer
progress are becoming undeniably visible. For many in-
dividuals this has led to a shift in perspective. An aware-
ness is growing today that the problems we face did not
“fall  from  Heaven,”  but  result  from  human  deeds,  the
source of which lies in human consciousness. To look at
the “outer” state of the world we have created is to see a
reflection  of  our  own  “inner”  state.  This  perspective  is
clearly reflected in Albert Gore’s widely read book Earth
in the Balance. Gore speaks of the profound separation
that has arisen in the course of Western cultural history
between our intellect and the physical world in which we
live. He sees this as a major source of the unhealthy rela-
tionship  to  our  natural  environment  which  is  visible  in
the ecological crisis we face today.

In light of such fundamental reflections on the founda-
tions of Western culture arising in our time, future gener-
ations  may  well  express  surprise  at  the  relative  unfami-
liarity of today’s American public with the work of Rudolf
Steiner; for Steiner devoted his whole life to overcoming
the gulf arising between science, art, and religion, between
clear scientific thinking and the belief in “higher” realities.
He did this in a manner that recognizes the inadequacy of


monolithic world views, in which everything is subsumed
under a universal principle. Already at the age of twenty-
five Steiner had formulated the nature of this problem, and
had shown in reference to the German poet and scientist
Goethe, a much wider perspective:

Goethe’s  world  view  is  the  most  many-sided
imaginable. It issues from a center resting within
the uniﬁed nature of the poet, and it always turns
outward  the  side  corresponding  to  the  nature  of
the object being considered. The unity of the spir-
itual  forces  being  exercised  lies  in  Goethe’s
nature;  the way  these  forces  are  exercised  at  any
given  moment  is  determined  by  the  object  under
consideration. Goethe takes his way of looking at
things  from  the  outer  world  and  does  not  force
any particular way upon it. These days, however,
the thinking of many people is active in only one
particular  way;  it  is  useful  for  only  one  category
of objects; it is not, like that of Goethe, uniﬁed but
rather uniform. . . .  Goethe’s  world  view  encom-
passes many directions of thought in the sense just
indicated and cannot, in fact, ever be imbued with
any single, one-sided conception.

(The Science of Knowing, pp.14-15)

What Steiner characterizes in regard to Goethe’s world

view is true to an even larger extent of his own.

But Rudolf Steiner was not only a thinker. His multi-
dimensional  approach  to  questions  of  practical  life  has


also  borne  significant  fruit.  Steiner  was,  in  fact,  the
founder of numerous impulses for the renewal of human
society: from the largest nonsectarian school movement
in the world today—Waldorf education—to the creation
of  new  forms  of  organic  agriculture,  holistic  medicine,
pharmacology  and  education  for  the  developmentally
handicapped. Not only was he a pioneer in the realm of
the  arts  and  architecture,  but  his  ideas  have  also  stimu-
lated new approaches in banking and organizational de-
velopment.  How,  future  generations  may  ask,  could  a
man capable of initiating such numerous impulses rele-
vant to the crisis of modern civilization remain almost un-
known in twentieth-century America?

That more people are searching for new ways of think-
ing and for new approaches to the multiplying challenges
of modern life is clearly apparent after a ten-minute visit
to the corner bookstore. But among the hundreds of books
one finds little or no Steiner. One explanation for this rel-
ative scarcity can be found by comparing his writings with
those otherwise available to the searching reader.

Rudolf Steiner’s books and published lecture cycles re-
veal themselves, upon closer scrutiny, to be difficult read-
ing. In our culture of the “quick-fix,” the effort required
to work through a book by Steiner will seem excessive to
many. Yet it is just this difficulty which gives his writings
much of their value. The central task of this introduction
to Steiner’s Theosophy will be to shed light upon this as-
pect of his writings. Hence we shall return repeatedly to
the question of why he wrote in the way he did, in order
to see more clearly what his intentions were.


II

There  are  many  entryways  into  the  work  of  Rudolf
Steiner. In fact, the confrontation with a collected works
of over 360 volumes (a great number of which are avail-
able in English) can be quite dismaying for the potential
student. Theosophy  is  one  good  starting  point;  Steiner
himself called it an introduction. Nonetheless he is care-
ful to point out that the words of Goethe with which chap-
ter 1 begins are “the starting point of one of the paths that
lead to being able to recognize the true nature of the hu-
man being” (italics added). Theosophy is a starting point,
and it is the exposition of one possible way to approach
the human riddle. Such an observation is characteristic of
Rudolf Steiner. Throughout his books and lecture cycles
he continually approaches fundamental questions of hu-
man existence from new and different perspectives. He
was  a  consistent  opponent  of  dogmatically  held  views
that seek to frame the depths of reality in rigid systems of
thought. This is important to keep in mind when reading
Theosophy, for it is but one of the ways in which Steiner
approaches the questions dealt with there. Rudolf Steiner
published Theosophy  after  two  decades  as  a  researcher
and author,1 primarily in the fields of philosophy and the
theory of science. It was a surprise to many.

1.  During  these  two  decades  he  was  the  editor  of  Goethe’s  natural
scientiﬁc works in two major editions, the editor of a twelve-volume
edition of Schopenhauer’s works and of an eight-volume edition of
Jean Paul.


xii i

Known  as  a  prodigious  student  of  past  and  modern
thought,  he  seemed  to  have  suddenly  overstepped  the
boundaries of accepted scientific thinking.

This reaction did not surprise Steiner. He was, after all,
an expert on questions of scientific method. In fact, it was
just this issue that he consciously raised with this book:
Have  the  limits  of  scientific  discourse  been  rightfully
drawn?

He characterized his spiritual scientific method (which
he  later  called  Anthroposophy)  as  one  that  “in  the  full
sense  of  the  word  recognizes  and  supports  the  current
view of natural scientific research where it is justified. On
the other hand it strives through the rigorous and ordered
training of purely inward (soul) faculties to achieve exact
and objective results about supersensible realms of exist-
ence. It gives validity only to those results won by inner
soul observation, in which the soul-spiritual organization
can be grasped and overviewed as exactly as a mathemat-
ical  problem.”  (Cosmology,  Religion  and  Philosophy,
pp.7-8, translation Michael Holdrege).

1. (continued) He was editor in chief of the Journal for Literature in
Berlin for several years, and his cultural and scientiﬁc essays written
for  various  journals  within  this  period  ﬁll  ﬁve  volumes  totalling
approximately three thousand pages. In addition to these activities he
authored  eight  books  during  this  phase  of  his  life: The  Science  of
Knowing,  Truth  and  Knowledge,  The  Philosophy  of  Freedom,
Friedrich Nietzsche—Fighter for Freedom, Goethe’s World Concep-
tion, Mysticism at the Dawn of the Modern Age, The Occult Move-
ment in the Nineteenth Century, and Christianity as Mystical Fact.


Rudolf Steiner was acutely aware not only of the sig-
nificance  of  modern  scientific  thought,  but  also  of  its
limitations. He strove to overcome the reduction of the
scientifically knowable world to those aspects of reality
accessible  only  to  outer  empiricism  and  mathematical
quantification,  while  at  the  same  time  upholding  the
rigor  and  objectivity  that  distinguishes  science  from
opinion.

But to expand the scientific method into deeper aspects
of existence is not a simple matter. It demands the careful
and exacting training of faculties that are for the most part
dormant in the human soul today. Rudolf Steiner went to
considerable pains to characterize the way in which such
faculties can be developed;2 for without such training the
possibilities for error and illusion are immense. It is be-
fore this background that Theosophy appears as one way
by  which  the  essential  nature  of  human  beings  can  be
known.

The demands of spiritual science are present not only
for the researcher; demands are also made of the reader.
As Theosophy unfolds, dimensions of human existence
not  accessible  to  “everyday”  experience  are  revealed,
presenting a significant challenge to the reader. If he or

2. In the lecture cycle The Boundaries of Natural Science, for exam-
ple, he frames this task in the context of modern science. A more gen-
eral  exposition  of  these  issues  is  in How  to  Know  Higher  Worlds
(previously,  Knowledge  of  the  Higher  Worlds  and  Its  Attainment),
which gives a short introduction to these questions in the last chapter.


she is to find a fruitful relationship to such supersensible
observations,  a  new  kind  of  reading  is  necessary.  As
Steiner says in the Preface to the Third Edition:

This book cannot be read the way people ordi-
narily  read  books  in  this  day  and  age.  In  some
respects,  its  readers  will  have  to  work  their  way
through each page and even each single sentence
the hard way. This was done deliberately; it is the
only way this book can become what it is intended
to be for the reader. Simply reading it through is
as good as not reading it at all. The spiritual scien-
tiﬁc truths it contains must be experienced; that is
the only way they can be of value.

The  book  is  consciously  written  in  a  manner  that  re-
quires  enhanced  activity  by  the  reader.  “. . .its  readers
will have to work their way through each page and even
each single sentence. . . ”, which is to say, that the con-
tents are not painless injections of spiritual knowledge, to
be received effortlessly and directly into the flow of the
reader’s  consciousness.  But  rather  it  is  what  the  reader
“does”  that  is  of  primary  significance.  To  become  in-
wardly  active  to  an  extent  far  beyond  that  required  by
most reading is the challenge of Rudolf Steiner’s books.
If we read Theosophy in an everyday manner, it can ap-
pear to be nothing but a systematic description of sensi-
ble  and  supersensible  members  of  the  human  being,  a
description that can be believed or not believed, depend-
ing on one’s disposition.


Steiner was clear about this:

I have often pointed out that there are two ways
of  reading  a  book  like  my Theosophy.  One  is  to
read, “The human being consists of physical body,
etheric  body,  astral  body,  etc.  and  lives  repeated
earth  lives  and  has  a  karma,  etc.”  A  reader  of  this
kind  is  taking  in  concepts.  They  are,  of  course,
rather  different  concepts  than  one  ﬁnds  elsewhere,
but the mental process that is going on is in many
respects  identical  with  what  takes  place  when  one
studies a cookbook. My point was exactly that the
process is the important thing, not the absorption of
ideas. It makes no difference whether you are read-
ing, “Put butter into a frying pan, add ﬂour, stir; add
the beaten eggs, etc.” or, “There is physical matter,
etheric forces, astral forces, and they interpenetrate
each other.” It is all one from the standpoint of the
soul  process  involved  whether  butter,  eggs,  and
ﬂour  are  being  mixed  at  a  stove  or  the  human
entelechy  is  conceived  as  a  mixture  of  physical,
etheric, and astral bodies.

But one can also read Theosophy in such a man-
ner as to realize that it contains concepts that stand
in the same relation to the world of ordinary physi-
cal concepts as the latter does to the dream world.
They belong to a world to which one has to awaken
out of the ordinary physical realm in just the way
one wakes out of one’s dream world into the physi-
cal. It is the attitude one has in reading that gives
things the right coloring.

Steiner does not simply give a systematic “cookbook”
description of the human being at different levels of exist-
ence. The concepts presented at the beginning of the book
grow, differentiate, and develop in a manner that easily
goes unnoticed to the casual reader. What appear at first
to be mere definitions reveal themselves to careful study
as many-faceted realities of human existence, which un-
dergo a “metamorphosis” as the book progresses. To en-
ter into the expansion and transformation of these ideas,
to make the subtle observations necessary to ground them
in one’s own experience, is not easy. It requires a height-
ened level of activity and concentration.

And yet it is just in this “more,” which a book such as
Theosophy necessitates, that its deeper fruitfulness for us
lies.  We  begin  to  exercise  those  faculties  of  cognition
which allow us with time to experience the realms of ex-
istence  spoken  of  by  Rudolf  Steiner.  Just  as  a  muscle
grows only through abnormal demands put upon it, so, in
a similar manner, do our inner faculties as well.

III

Chapter  1  of Theosophy  begins  with  the  trichotomy  of
body,  soul  and  spirit.  Although  appearing  to  revive  an-
tique distinctions about the human organization, Steiner
is  careful  to  point  out  that  whoever  associates  precon-
ceived  notions  with  these  three  words  will  necessarily
misunderstand  what  is  meant.  These  concepts  are  to  be
understood  only  through  subtle  observation  of  the  phe-
nomena themselves.


Further reading shows that the human being is not sim-
ply made up of body, soul and spirit (and their further dif-
ferentiations), but exists as a unique individuality—an “I”
—that  is  active  within  these  three  regions  of  its  being.
This individuality is not simply the sum of its parts, it is
an active transformative agent within them.

What we know as our “I” at our current level of devel-
opment is but a beginning. What Steiner points to in the
concepts “spirit self,” “life spirit,” and “spirit body” is
the largely untapped potentiality of the human “I” to pen-
etrate ever more deeply its soul and bodily nature, spiri-
tualizing  and  individualizing  them  in  the  process.  The
picture that arises in chapter 1 is of the human being in
an  evolutive  process  of  becoming,  with  the  agent  of
transformation  being  the  activity  of  the  “I”  itself.  Dis-
covering this possibility in oneself is the first step in the
conscious realization of this potentiality. In the words of
Johannes Tauler, “If I were King in a land and did not
know it, I would not be King.” Chapter 1 seeks, among
other things, to bring this largely dormant “Kingship” to
our awareness.

IV

Building on his description of the differentiated nature of
the human being, Steiner attempts to show in chapter 2
the extent to which it is possible to speak of repeated earth
lives and destiny on the basis of experiences accessible to
ordinary  human  consciousness.  This  is  a  very  difficult


undertaking, as Steiner was well aware. Many years later
he commented on the challenges this section of the book
presented him:

For  one  who  wishes  to  remain  scientiﬁc  the
presentation of repeated earth lives becomes very
difﬁcult. . . .  If  it  is  not  desired  at  this  point  to
speak merely out of spiritual perceptions, it is nec-
essary  to  resort  to  ideas  which  result,  to  be  sure,
from a subtle observation of the sense-world, but
which people fail to grasp. For such a more subtle
way  of  observing,  the  human  being  is  seen  to  be
different  in  organization  and  evolution  from  the
animal  world.  And,  if  this  fact  of  difference  is
observed,  life  itself  gives  rise  to  the  idea  of
repeated earthly lives. But no attention is paid to
this: hence such ideas seem not to have been taken
from life, but to have been conceived arbitrarily or
simply picked up out of more ancient views.

I faced these difﬁculties in full consciousness. I
battled with them. Any one who will take the trou-
ble to review the successive editions of my Theos-
ophy  and  see  how  I  recast  again  and  again  the
chapter on repeated earthly lives, for the very pur-
pose  of  bringing  the  truth  of  this  perception  into
relation  with  those  ideas  which  are  taken  from
observation  of  the  sense  world,  will  ﬁnd  what
pains I took to do justice to the recognized scien-
tiﬁc method.

(The Course of My Life, pp. 329-30)


From  these  words  it  is  evident  how  this  chapter  con-
sciously appeals to the reader’s ability to make more subtle
observations  of  the  sense  world  than  is  normally  done.
These observations provide the necessary basis for form-
ing an idea of repeated earth lives. Only then does this idea
lose its seemingly arbitrary character. In the course of the
chapter Steiner guides the reader to consider more care-
fully than usual the nature of memory, how abilities arise
out of experiences forgotten, the unique quality of every
human biography, the similarities between “natural” gifts
and faculties developed through practice, and so on.

Such observations awaken us to aspects of life which
we  normally  overlook.  They  form  the  basis  for  new
thoughts about the genesis and development of the human
individuality.  They  can  lead  to  the  conclusion,  as  does
this chapter, that “in each life the human spirit appears as
a repetition of itself, with the fruits of its experiences in
earlier lifetimes” (p. 81). Steiner’s considerations are not,
in  the  normal  sense  of  the  word,  a  “proof”  of  repeated
earth lives. But they show that such thoughts can be ar-
rived at when founded on discerning observation.

Why does Steiner take such pains to develop an idea
that in the end appears only in its shadowy contours? In
other  contexts  we  find  him  describing  very  concretely
and  in  great  detail  how  the  laws  of  reincarnation  and
karma work within human existence. But in this chapter
he follows a specific intention:

(The author) has pointed out that the conviction
to  which  these  thoughts  lead  is  only  sketchily


deﬁned by them, that all they can do is prepare us
in thought for what must ultimately be discovered
by means of spiritual research. In itself, however,
as long as this thought preparation does not exag-
gerate its own importance or attempt to prove any-
thing, but only trains our soul, it entails an inner
effort that can make us unbiased and receptive to
facts we would simply take for foolish without it.
 (Addendum, p. 91, italics added)

Steiner’s intent is not to prove, it is to prepare and en-
able. He provides in the thought forms of this chapter a
means for the soul to exercise its own faculties, faculties
that will eventually lead to the certainty of reincarnation
and karma out of one’s own unmitigated experience.

V

Chapter 3 places the concepts of body, soul, and spirit into
a much wider context. For just as the physical body can be
understood only within the field of forces and substances
of outer nature, so also must soul and spirit be considered
in  the  context  of  their  corresponding  “environments.”
Steiner describes how, in the same sense that our physical
body is not isolated within its own skin, independent of the
natural world around it, neither does that which we know
inwardly as the soul and spiritual aspects of our existence
(see chapter 1) exist in isolation. They are part of a larger
whole. The soul and spiritual worlds that Rudolf Steiner


depicts do not, however, follow the laws of physics and bi-
ology as outer nature does. The “soul world” (Seelenwelt),
as he describes it, is woven out of the interaction of two
fundamental principles: sympathy and antipathy. Within
the “country of spirit beings” (Geisterland), the spiritual
archetypes,  of  which  our  ordinary  thinking  is  but  a
shadow, are the creative law-giving elements.

Chapter 3 sets forth how these higher laws work within
the development of the human being and shows their sig-
nificance as constitutive elements within the kingdoms of
nature.

Steiner is careful to note the difficulties involved in us-
ing language developed in reference to the sense-percep-
tible world to describe these levels of reality. Only with
the help of similes and comparison is it possible to con-
vey  an  impression  of  these  “higher”  worlds.  This  diffi-
culty  is  apparent  from  the  very  beginning  of  this
chapter—we see it in the use of the word “world.” The
soul and spiritual worlds Steiner describes are not to be
pictured  spatially,  as  being  somewhere  else,  next  to,  or
outside the physical. “These are states of consciousness,
not places. One does not move from one location to the
next when one moves through these regions” (Grundbe-
griffe der Theosophie, Nov. 7, 1904; italics added).

 Thus, when Steiner speaks of journeys, of regions that
are entered, we must keep characterizations such as the
following in mind: “In physical space, . . .  when we look
down an avenue the distant trees appear, according to the
laws  of  perspective,  to  stand  closer  together  than  those
nearby. In soul space on the contrary, all objects appear at


xxi ii

distances corresponding to their inner nature.” This is not
the space of “next to,” or of “above and below.” It is a
qualitative “space” of inner relationship. A hint of such
“soul space” comes to expression when we speak of being
“close” to someone, or having grown inwardly “distant.”
To stretch our imagination beyond the familiar realm of
three-dimensional experience is but one of the challenges
this chapter presents.

Rudolf  Steiner’s  descriptions  of  the  soul  world  and
spirit land, if taken seriously, shed tremendous light upon
human existence. Nonetheless, for some readers they will
appear  to  be  unsupported  pronouncements  far  from  ev-
eryday  life.  Steiner  recognized  this  possibility  and  de-
scribed what was necessary to avoid it:

[Someone] who has read the preceding discus-
sions [chapters 1 and 2] only in order to take cog-
nizance of the content, will ﬁnd the truths set forth
in  these  chapters  [on  the  soul  world  and  spirit
land] to be mere assertions arbitrarily uttered. . . .
[Anyone]  who  reads  the  ﬁrst  expositions  in  my
book Theosophy  without  the  impression  of  an
inner  experience,  so  that  he  or  she  does  not
become  aware  of  a  metamorphosis  of  his  or  her
inner experience of ideas . . . can only arrive at a
rejection  of  the  book.  But  an  anthroposophical
book  is  designed  to  be  taken  up  in  inner  experi-
ence.  Then  by  stages  a  form  of  understanding
comes about. This may be very weak, but it can—

Anthroposophical book should be an awakener of
the  life  of  the  spirit  in  the  reader, not  a  certain
quantity of information imparted. The reading of
it  should  be  an  experiencing  with  inner  shocks,
tensions, solutions.

The  issue  of  a  “rightly  composed  Anthroposophical
book” has been an ongoing theme of this introduction. At
the beginning of the final chapter of Theosophy Rudolf
Steiner addresses just this matter. For here he describes
the path of knowledge, the way, namely, in which one at-
tains  to  the  supersensible  knowledge  put  forth  in  this
book. This path, he maintains, must take its starting point
from  the  realization  that  “thinking  is  the  highest  of  the
faculties we human beings possess in the physical world”
(p. 176). This observation plays a central role in the work
of Rudolf Steiner. Throughout his life he addressed this
issue,  shedding  light  upon  it  from  the  most  varied  per-
spectives. Already his first book, The Science of Know-
ing, written at the age of twenty five, contains a chapter
entitled “Thinking as a Higher Experience within Experi-
ence.” There he observes:

With the rest of experience, if I stay with what
lies  immediately  before  my  senses,  I  cannot  get
beyond the particulars. Assume that I have a liquid


which I bring to a boil. At ﬁrst it is still; then I see
bubbles rise; the liquid comes into movement and
ﬁnally passes over into vapor form. Those are the
successive  individual  perceptions.  I  can  twist  and
turn  the  matter  however  I  want:  if  I  remain  with
what  the  senses  provide,  I  ﬁnd  no  connection
between  the  facts.  With  thinking  this  is  not  the
case.  If,  for  example  I  grasp  the  thought  “cause,”
this leads me by its own content to that of “effect.”
I  need  only  hold  onto  the  thoughts  in  the  form  in
which  they  appear  in  direct  experience  and  they
manifest already as lawful characterizations.

What,  for  the  rest  of  experience,  must  ﬁrst  be
brought from somewhere else—if it is applicable
to experience at all—namely, lawful interconnec-
tion, is already present in thinking in its very ﬁrst
appearance. . . . In thinking, what we must seek for
with the rest of experience has itself become direct
experience.

(The Science of Knowing, p. 35-6)

Within  the  transparency  of  thinking  we  discover  the
laws  of  nature.  The  interrelationships  between  the  phe-
nomena of the sense world are not accessible to eyes and
ears. (Otherwise the greatest scientists would simply be
those with the best trained senses.) They first appear in
thinking as a “higher experience within experience.” Re-
ferring to the fact that our thinking life as such is not sense
perceptible (he does not mean in this context our mental
representations of the sense world), Steiner once spoke of


a “pearl” contained therein, that normally remains unrec-
ognized and thus undervalued.

. . .no  one  could think  abstractly,  could  have
thoughts and ideas if he or she were not clairvoy-
ant.  For  in  our  ordinary  thinking  the pearl  of
clairvoyance is  from  the  start  contained.  These
thoughts  and  ideas  arise  in  the  soul  through
exactly the same process as that which gives rise
to its highest powers. And it is immensely impor-
tant  to  learn  to  understand  that  clairvoyance
begins in  something  common  and  everyday.  We
only have to recognize the supersensible nature of
our concepts and ideas. We must realize that these
come  to  us  from  supersensible  worlds;  only  then
can we look at the matter rightly.
(The Occult Signiﬁcance of the Bhagavad Gita, lec-
ture, May 29, 1913, pp. 25-6; italics added; see also
T. Meyer, Clairvoyance and Consciousness, p. 54)

These supersensible worlds are the spiritual archetypes
described in chapter 3. But, as Steiner points out there,
our thoughts are merely a “shadowy picture” of their true
reality in the supersensible world. In his book Riddles of
the Soul Steiner describes how what we grasp in thinking
loses its living reality as an active agency when it enters
our consciousness as a concept. The transparent content
(the  pearl)  remains,  but  its  effectual  reality  is  relin-
quished. This, as he further describes, has great signifi-
cance, for if we were to experience our ideas in all their


xxvi i

dynamic vitality, we could never achieve individual free-
dom, nor self-consciousness. Existent forces, if they were
to  enter  our  consciousness  in  this  form,  would  compel.
Transparent thought semblances of these forces can not.
The latter we are free to accept in insight and to take up
as impulses for our own self-willed actions.3 In a related
sense, Steiner also describes how we would never be able
to achieve self-consciousness if continually immersed in
the sea of forces which make up the actual substance of
the thought world.

It is Steiner’s conviction that only on the basis of this
“abstract” thinking can true self-consciousness and free-
dom of the human will be attained. Nonetheless, if we are
to  know  the  true  nature  of  the  human  being  we  must
progress beyond this stage of consciousness, using it as a
healthy foundation for a deeper penetration into the reali-
ties of human existence. For this deeper penetration, our
thought life must gradually awaken to the living realities
out of which it originates.

Despite  the  “devitalized”  nature  of  our  normal  con-
cepts, Rudolf Steiner describes how this condition can be
overcome through the thought forms of spiritual science,
if they are taken up in the right way:

Spiritual  science  puts  in  the  place  of  ﬁnished
concepts . . . something  that  the  soul  must  repeat-
edly work on anew; something that the soul must
join with over and over again. If we have a good

memory,  we  can  receive  the  external  truths  as
given  to  us  by  natural  science  once  (and  for  all)
and then possess them—because natural scientiﬁc
truths  are  given  in  concepts  that  are,  to  a  certain
extent,  dead.  Natural  laws,  as  concepts,  are  dead.
Spiritual scientiﬁc concepts must be given in living
concepts. If we condemn spiritual scientiﬁc truths
to be dead concepts, if we take them in in the way
we take in natural truths, then they are not food for
the  soul,  but  stones  which  cannot  be  digested. . . .
This is certainly something about spiritual science
that  leaves  many  people  unsatisﬁed,  since  they
would like to have something ﬁnished.
(Aspects  of  Human  Evolution,  lecture,  July  24,
1917; see also G. Kühlewind, Working with Anthro-
posophy, p. 74)

In  this  sense  Rudolf  Steiner  sees  the  first  step  in  the
“path of knowledge” to be the active assimilation of spir-
itual scientific concepts. “Do not believe what I tell you,
but think it”—that is his appeal to the reader. For these
concepts  are,  he  argues,  seminal  in  nature,  they  are  a
means to awakening one’s own consciousness to the liv-
ing realities out of which not only our thought life, but ul-
timately the realms of nature around us come forth (see
chapter 3). This is not a question of belief, Steiner main-
tains, but a matter of experience. Experience that gradu-
ally becomes accessible through the energetic application
of one’s thought forces to contents such as are those con-
tained in this book.

But the enlivening of one’s thinking is only one aspect
of this path of development. The characterization of our
thinking faculty as latent with higher capacities is also ap-
plicable to many aspects of the human being. How other
human faculties can be consciously schooled so as to be-
come organs of higher experience is the primary content
of chapter 4. Already in the first pages of Theosophy a de-
scription  of  various  “sides”  of  the  human  being  was
given, showing different ways in which we are connected
with  the  world:  through  perception,  feeling,  will,  and
thinking.  Whereas  the  first  chapter  remains  primarily  a
description  of  these  faculties,  at  the  end  of Theosophy
they are viewed from a developmental perspective.

 Although a healthy expansion of human consciousness
begins with the faculty of thinking, it can only be realized
at deeper levels when the “whole” human being is trans-
formed. Chapter 4 shows the characteristic kinds of trans-
formation the individual must undertake if he or she is to
overcome the separation from the deeper aspects of real-
ity  created  by  the  limitations  of  our  “everyday”  human
qualities. This transformation, as Steiner describes it here,
must be realized through the efforts of the human “I” it-
self. This core of our self-conscious being (see chapter 1)
must take on this task through its own forces. Emphasiz-
ing this is essential in Steiner’s view of the human being.
The  path  of  development  which  he  represents  does  not
happen  “to”  the  human  being,  but  is  brought  about
through the growing forces of the individuality (“I”) it-
self. Acting out of insight into the hindrances that it bears
within its own bodily and soul nature, the human “I” can


take upon itself a path of development which will enable
it  in  time  to  overcome  those  limitations,  transforming
them lastly into organs of higher experience. This does
not  take  place  at  the  expense  of  the  individuality,  but
through its enhancement.

VII

Does  all  this  have  relevance  for  the  special  difficulties
we face at the end of the twentieth century? Can Rudolf
Steiner’s Theosophy  help  us  to  overcome  the  two  cul-
tures of which Snow spoke? Can it help us to free our-
selves  from  the  “paradigm  rigidity”  which  threatens  to
splinter modern life into endless points of view? Can it,
lastly,  help  us  to  find  new  ways  to  meet  the  concrete
problems  that  modern  society  puts  before  us  in  ever
greater number?

This  would  be  a  great  deal  to  demand  of  one  small
book.  In  reality  these  questions  would  have  to  be  ad-
dressed to Steiner’s work as a whole—Anthroposophy. A
careful study of the latter shows that Steiner did not bring
a  series  of  “ready-made”  solutions  for  all  of  the  chal-
lenges that face humanity today. What he did bring are
deepened perspectives about the nature of the human be-
ing and the world of which it is a part. These perspectives
lie hidden for the most part to the prevailing conscious-
ness of our time. But they can be discovered by the con-
scientious pursuit of “higher” knowledge set forth in this
book.  Steiner’s  conviction  is  that  by  discovering  the


deeper  wellsprings  of  our  human  existence,  we  will  be
able to heal in time the alienation that besets society to-
day, to overcome those narrow perspectives that separate
rather than unite. Such understanding can lead, lastly, as
Rudolf Steiner himself was able to demonstrate in many
realms of practical endeavor, to a renewal of human soci-
ety down into the smallest details of “everyday” life.

Before the ninth edition of this book was printed in l918,
I  thoroughly  revised  and  updated  the  text.  This  current
edition has not been revised to the same extent, in spite of
the  fact  that  the  publication  of  articles  attacking  the  an-
throposophical world-view this book presents has stepped
up considerably since l918. However, in the course of all
my works, I make a practice of raising all foreseeable ob-
jections myself in order to be able to assess how serious
they are and then refute them. Anyone who takes note of
this will have a good idea of my response to these attacks.
This time there was no intrinsic reason to make changes in
the text as I had done in 1918, and although anthroposo-
phy’s  worldview  has  certainly  grown  both  broader  and
deeper within my soul during the last four years, this has
not led to any earth-shattering changes in the book’s con-
tent. On the contrary, what I have learned in the meantime
suggests that I am justified in making no significant alter-
ations to the content of this basic text.

Once again, as I have done prior to the publication of sev-
eral other editions of this book, I have reviewed the mate-
rial presented in it, and the revisions for this ninth edition
have  expanded  the  content  considerably.  You  will  find
that the chapter on reincarnation and karma has been al-
most completely reworked. I found no reason, however,
to amend any of the results of spiritual scientific research
presented  in  previous  editions.  Nothing  significant  has
been omitted in this edition, but much has been added.

As a spiritual researcher, I constantly feel the need to
shed new light on my subject from different angles in an
attempt to make it ever clearer. In the preface to the sixth
edition, I already mentioned feeling compelled to put my
ongoing inner experience to optimum use in each nuance
and turn of phrase. I have been especially aware of this
obligation in preparing this new edition, which can there-
fore  quite  justifiably  be  called  “thoroughly  revised  and
updated.”

Almost every time it has become necessary to reprint this
book,  I  have  set  myself  the  task  of  carefully  reviewing
and revising its contents. This time was no exception, but
what I have to say about this new revision is similar to
what I had to say about the third edition, so I will retain
that Preface for this printing.

However, this time I have taken particular care to ex-
press many details with greater clarity than I had been ca-
pable of doing in any of the previous editions, although I
realize that much remains to be done in this regard. In de-
picting the spiritual world, a researcher is dependent on
the soul wending its own way toward the discovery of the
pertinent word or appropriate phrase to express a fact or
an  experience.  Somewhere  along  this  way,  at  the  right
moment, this word or phrase, sought in vain when sought
deliberately, simply appears. I believe that in many places
in this new edition, I have been able to make a significant
step in communicating details important for understand-
ing the spiritual world. In fact, only now do some things
seem to be presented as they should be. I must say that
this volume has been part of my inner struggle for further
knowledge  of  the  spiritual  world  during  the  ten  years


since  its  first  publication.  Although  the  basic  structure
and even the wording of all crucial passages may be the
same in this as in all earlier versions, it is noticeable at
many junctures that I am now encountering my subject as
a  living  thing,  nourishing  it  on  what  I  believe  I  have
gained in ten years of challenging spiritual research. Of
course it was necessary to keep all changes within quite
modest limits if the book was to be simply a new edition
of  the  old  one  rather  than  something  totally  new,  but  I
made a particular effort to make sure that the Addenda
would enable readers to find within the text itself the an-
swers  to  many  of  the  questions  that  might  arise  in  the
course of reading it.

These are agitated times, and my heart is moved as I
write these lines prefacing this book’s sixth edition. The
printing  had  been  completed  up  to  page  192  when  the
destiny-laden events humanity is now experiencing broke
in upon Europe. It did not seem right to write this Preface
without acknowledging the storms breaking in upon our
souls in times like these.

What I said on the occasion of the second printing of this
book applies equally to this third edition. This time, too,
individual  passages  have  been  expanded  and  revised
where I deemed it important for the sake of making as-
pects of the presentation more precise. However, I did not
find it necessary to make any substantial changes in the
content of the first and second editions, and nothing I said
in the two earlier Prefaces with regard to the book’s task
and purpose needs to be revised at this time, so the Pref-
ace to the first edition, supplemented by the new material
added in the Preface to the second, will serve as Preface
for this edition as well:

Since the purpose of this book is to depict some portions
of the supersensible world, anyone believing only in the
validity  of  the  sense-perceptible  world  will  take  it  as  a
meaningless figment of the imagination. However, those
interested  in  finding  pathways  leading  out  of  the  sense-
perceptible  world  will  soon  realize  that  human  life  ac-
quires  value  and  meaning  only  through  insight  into  an-
other world. Many people are afraid that this insight might
estrange them from “real life,” but this fear is not justified.


On the contrary, this insight is the only way to learn to
hold one’s ground in ordinary life. It teaches us the causes
underlying our life, while without it we would be groping
our  way  blindly  through  the  effects.  It  is  only  through
knowledge of the supersensible that our sense-perceptible
“reality”  acquires  meaning,  and  this  knowledge  makes
people  more  fit  for  life  rather  than  less  so,  since  only
someone who understands life can be truly practical.

In compiling this book, I have included nothing I can-
not testify to on the basis of personal experience in this
field. Only my direct experience is presented here.

This  book  cannot  be  read  the  way  people  ordinarily
read books in this day and age. In some respects, its read-
ers will have to work their way through each page and
even each single sentence the hard way. This was done
deliberately; it is the only way this book can become what
it  is  intended  to  be  for  the  reader.  Simply  reading  it
through is as good as not reading it at all. The spiritual
scientific truths it contains must be experienced; that is
the only way they can be of value.

This book cannot be assessed from the vantage point of
current  science  unless  the  appropriate  perspective  has
been acquired by means of the book itself. If its critics can
adopt this point of view, they will realize that what is pre-
sented here is in no way contradictory to a truly scholarly
and  scientific  approach.  I  am  sure  that  I  have  set  down
nothing that would conflict with my own scientific scruples.
If a different way of seeking the truths presented here
is wanted, one can be found in my Philosophy of Free-
dom. These two books have the same goal but approach


it  differently.  For  understanding  either  of  these  books,
the other one is by no means necessary, although some
people may find it helpful.

Some  readers,  hoping  to  find  the  “ultimate”  truth  in
this book, may set it aside unsatisfied. However, its pur-
pose is to present simply the most basic truths in the field
of spiritual science. Of course, it is only human to imme-
diately want to know how the world began and how it will
end,  to  ask  about  the  meaning  of  life  and  the  nature  of
God. However, I am concerned not with mere words and
concepts  for  people’s  rational  understanding,  but  with
truly  viable  knowledge,  knowledge  for  life,  and  I  know
that certain things belonging to more advanced stages of
wisdom may not be said in a book dealing with elemen-
tary levels of spiritual knowledge. Only through under-
standing these elementary stages can we learn how to ask
questions of a higher sort. My book Occult Science picks
up where this book leaves off and contains more informa-
tion on the subjects we will be discussing here.

The Preface to the second edition included the follow-

ing additional comments:

In this  day  and  age,  anyone  presenting  supersensible
realities must be quite clear about two things: one, that
the cultivation of supersensible knowledge is a necessity
for  our  times;  and  two,  that  because  of  the  kinds  of
thoughts and feelings pervading our culture, many people
can only take any documentation of this sort to be the pro-
duct of an imagination run wild. Supersensible knowledge


is  a  necessity  for  our  times  because  all  the  knowledge
about  life  and  the  world  that  we  acquire  by  ordinary
means  generates  countless  questions  that  can  be  an-
swered only by means of supersensible truths. Let’s not
deceive ourselves—what present-day cultural trends can
teach  us  about  the  basis  of  existence  will  never  answer
any of life’s great riddles in the mind of a deeply feeling
person; it will only raise questions. People may believe
for a while that conclusions drawn from “strictly scien-
tific data” or the deductions of some modern thinker or
other will provide a solution to the riddles of life, but in
the  depths  of  soul  where  true  self-knowledge  becomes
possible, what at first looked like a solution will only in-
cite us to find the true question. And this question’s an-
swer should not simply satisfy our curiosity, for our inner
equanimity  and  psychological  integrity  depend  on  it.  It
should  not  simply  satisfy  our  thirst  for  knowledge,  but
should also make us fit to work and to face our tasks in
life. On the other hand, if no answer to such questions is
forthcoming, we become psychologically (and ultimately
also physically) crippled. Supersensible knowledge is not
a mere theoretical need; it is a matter of how we lead our
practical life. And because of the state of our modern cul-
ture, knowledge of the spirit has become a field of study
we cannot afford to ignore.

On the other hand, of course, what many people nowa-
days reject most emphatically is precisely what they most
urgently  need.  The  weight  of  opinion  based  on  “irrefut-
able scientific results” is so overwhelming for many peo-
ple  that  they  cannot  help  thinking  that  a  book  like  this


contains nothing but blatant nonsense. However, it is quite
possible for someone who can describe supersensible ex-
periences  to  be  free  of  any  illusions  while  doing  so.  Of
course people are tempted to insist that this person present
“incontrovertible  proof”  of  what  he  or  she  is  talking
about, but in succumbing to this temptation they succumb
to an illusion as well. Without being aware of it, what they
are demanding is not a proof intrinsic to the subject, but
the kind of proof they themselves are willing and able to
accept.

I know that I have written nothing in this book that any-
one with a grounding in modern science would be unable
to accept on that basis. I know that it is possible to fulfill
all  the  requirements  of  science  and  yet  apply  that  same
background to recognizing that the method used here in
describing  the  spiritual  world  is  intrinsic  to  its  subject.
Anyone with a genuinely scientific way of thinking should
feel quite at home in what I have to say, and will experi-
ence in many arguments to the contrary that, as Goethe so
rightly put it, “A false teaching is not open to refutation be-
cause it rests on the conviction that what is false is true.”
It is pointless to enter into discussion with people who will
accept  only  the  validity  of  proofs  that  already  lie  within
their  personal  mode  of  thought.  But  the  mind  has  other
ways of arriving at the truth than through arguing, as any-
one aware of the essential nature of “proof” will know.

With this in mind, I offer the second edition of this book

to the public.

As an aid to readers wishing to follow the text in German,
the numbers that appear in the margins indicate
Rudolf Steiner’s original paragraphing
in the German edition.


I N T R O D U C T I O N

In  the  autumn  of  1813,  the  German  philosopher  Johann
Gottlieb Fichte published his Science of Knowledge, the
mature fruit of a lifetime wholly dedicated to the service
of truth. At the very beginning of this work, he wrote:

[1]

This  doctrine  presupposes  the  existence  of  a
quite new inner sensory instrument through which
a new world is opened up, a world that simply does
not exist for the ordinary person.

Fichte then showed by means of a comparison how in-
comprehensible this doctrine would be to anyone who in-
sists on judging it on the basis of what our ordinary senses
present:

Imagine a world of people all born blind. They
can  only  know  about  the  existence  and  interrela-
tionships of things that exist for the sense of touch.
If  you  talk  to  them  about  colors  and  about  other
relationships  that  exist  only  through  light  and  the


sense of sight, you might as well be saying nothing
at all. If you are lucky, they will inform you of this
fact so that you notice your error and can at least
refrain from further useless talk if you prove inca-
pable of opening their eyes.1

All  too  often,  someone  trying  to  talk  to  people  about
things such as those mentioned by Fichte is in a position
similar to that of a seeing person among the blind. Yet it is
precisely these things that are of relevance to the true na-
ture and highest goals of human beings, and anyone who
really believed it necessary to “refrain from further useless
talk” would have to give up on humanity in despair. But
we must not doubt for a single moment that it is possible
to “open the eyes” of any person who responds to these
things with good will. This has always been the assump-
tion of people who wrote and spoke out of feeling their
own  “inner  sensory  instrument”  maturing  within  them,
and were thus able to recognize the true nature of the hu-
man being, which is hidden from the outer senses. This is
why a “hidden wisdom” has been spoken of since time im-
memorial. Those who have grasped something of this hid-
den wisdom are as secure in their possession of it as people
with  normal  eyes  are  in  their  ability  to  visualize  color;
thus, they need no “proof” of it. They also know that no

Consciousness,”  given  at  the  University  of  Berlin,  1812-13.  Pub-

proof  is  needed  for  anyone  whose  “higher  sense,”  like
their own, has been opened. They can speak to such a per-
son just as a traveler might speak about a foreign country
to people who have never been there personally, but who
can  imagine  it  because  they  would  see  the  very  same
things, given the opportunity.

However, those capable of observing the supersensible
world should speak not only to spiritual researchers but to
everyone, since what they have to tell concerns each one of
us.  In  fact,  they  know  that  without  some  knowledge  of
these things, no one can be human in the true sense of the
word. They speak to all of us, knowing that what they have
to say will be met with varying degrees of understanding,
but also knowing that since a feeling for the truth and the
ability to understand it are present in every human being,
even  those  who  are  still  far  from  being  able  to  conduct
spiritual research on their own may be able to respond with
understanding. This understanding, which can light up in
any healthy human soul, is what spiritual researchers ad-
dress  first,  and  they  know  that  it  has  a  power  that  must
gradually  lead  to  the  higher  stages  of  knowledge.  This
feeling for truth stirs in the darkness. Although it may at
first see absolutely nothing of what is described, it is the
magician who opens the “eye of the spirit.” The soul does
not yet see, but this feeling allows the power of truth to
take hold of it, so that truth then gradually draws near the
soul and opens its “higher sense.” This may take more time
or less, depending on the individual, but anyone with pa-
tience and perseverance will reach this goal. For although
not every person born physically blind can be successfully


[3]

operated  on,  every  spiritual  eye  can  be  opened; when  it
will be opened is simply a question of time.

[4]

Neither  academic  learning  nor  scientific  training  is  a
prerequisite for opening this higher sense; it can open up
for a naive and uneducated person as readily as for a re-
nowned scientist. In fact, what is nowadays often consid-
ered  the  one  and  only  science  is  more  likely  to  be  a
hindrance than a help on the way to this goal, because it
characteristically accepts as “real” only what is accessible
to  our  ordinary  senses.  However  great  the  successes  of
science in understanding sense-perceptible reality may be,
when it takes what is both necessary and beneficial in its
own realm as the standard for all human knowledge, it cre-
ates  a  profusion  of  prejudices  that  block  our  access  to
higher realities.

The objection is often raised that human knowledge has
been set “insurmountable limits,” once and for all, which
cannot be transcended, and any knowledge that disregards
them must be rejected out of hand. Anyone who claims
such  knowledge  is  considered  highly  presumptous.This
objection  totally  fails  to  take  into  account  the  fact  that
higher knowledge can come about only if a development
of human cognitive powers precedes it. What lies outside
the limits of human knowledge prior to this development
lies well within them once the faculties that lie dormant in
each individual have been awakened.

One  point  should  not  be  overlooked,  however.  We
could ask what good it does to talk to people about things
for which their cognitive faculties are not yet awakened
and that are therefore inaccessible to them. However, this


is not the right way to look at the issue. We do need certain
faculties in order to discover the kinds of things we are
talking  about,  but  if  these  ideas,  once  discovered,  are
shared and made known to others, they can be understood
by anyone willing to apply impartial logic and a healthy
feeling for the truth. To individuals who allow open, unbi-
ased thinking and an unhampered, independent feeling for
the  truth  to  work  freely  within  them,  this  book  presents
only  things  that  offer  a  satisfying  and  convincing  ap-
proach to the riddles of human life and the phenomena of
the world around us. Ask yourselves this question: If the
statements made in this book are true, do they offer a con-
vincing explanation of life? You will find that the life of
every human being offers confirmation that they do.

In order to be a “teacher” in these higher regions of ex-
istence,  however,  having  acquired  the  faculty  for  per-
ceiving  them  is  not  enough.  Systematic  knowledge
belongs here as much as it does to the profession of teach-
ing on the level of ordinary reality. “Higher seeing” does
not make a person a “knower” in the spirit any more than
healthy senses make a “scholar” in sense-perceptible re-
ality. But in truth, all reality is one; since the lower reality
and  the  higher  spiritual  reality  are  merely  two  sides  of
one and the same fundamental unity of being, a person
who  is  ignorant  with  regard  to  lower  knowledge  will
probably remain similarly ignorant of higher things. This
basic fact calls up a feeling of boundless responsibility in
those  who,  through  a  spiritual  calling,  feel  obliged  to
speak  out  about  spiritual  regions  of  existence.  It  im-
presses  on  them  the  need  for  humility  and  restraint.  It

[5]


should  not,  however,  discourage  anyone  from  looking
into higher truths, not even someone whose everyday life
offers no opportunity to study the ordinary sciences. It is
quite possible to fulfill our tasks as human beings with-
out  understanding  anything  about  botany,  zoology,
mathematics or other sciences, but it is not possible to be
“human” in the fullest sense of the word without coming
closer in some way to the essential nature and destiny of
the human being as revealed through knowledge of the
supersensible world.

As human beings we call the highest thing we can look
up to “the Divine,” and we must imagine that our highest
aim and calling have something to do with this divine el-
ement. This may well be why wisdom that transcends the
sense-perceptible world, that reveals to us both our essen-
tial nature and our destiny, is called theosophy, or “divine
wisdom.” The name “spiritual science” can be given to
the observation of spiritual processes in human life and in
the cosmos. If, as has been done in this book, we extract
from  spiritual  science  the  phenomena  pertaining  espe-
cially to the essential spiritual core of the human being,
then we can use the term “theosophy” for this particular
subject  area,  since  it  has  been  applied  in  this  sense  for
centuries.

The above viewpoint provided the basis for developing
this outline of the theosophical worldview. Its author has
included nothing that is not fact and reality for him in the
same sense that events in the outer world are facts and re-
alities for our eyes, ears and ordinary understanding. Here,
we are dealing with experiences that become accessible to

[6]

[7]


anyone determined to set off on the path to knowledge de-
scribed in the last chapter of this book. We approach the
things of the supersensible world with the right attitude if
we take it as a given that sound thinking and perception
are capable of understanding all true knowledge that can
flow toward us from the higher worlds. We should also
recognize that by taking this kind of understanding as our
starting point and laying a firm foundation with it, we are
taking a great and important first step toward higher see-
ing for ourselves, although other things must also contrib-
ute if we are to achieve this goal. However, if we scorn
this approach and try to reach the higher worlds by other
means alone, we bar the door to true higher knowledge.
If, on principle we admit the existence of higher worlds
only once we have seen them for ourselves, this in itself
is an obstacle to ever being able to see them, but being de-
termined to use sound thinking to understand first what
we will later be able to observe actually fosters this see-
ing. It summons up important forces of the soul that lead
to this seership.

## CHAPTER 1

### THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF THE HUMAN BEING

The following words by Goethe beautifully characterize
the starting point of one of the paths that lead to being able
to recognize the true nature of the human being:

[1]

As  soon  as  we  become  aware  of  the  objects
around us, we start to consider them in relationship
to  ourselves,  and  rightly  so,  because  our  fate  de-
pends entirely on whether they please or displease,
attract or repel,  help or  harm  us. This very natural
way of looking at and assessing things appears to be
as easy as it is necessary, yet it exposes us to thou-
sands of errors that often put us to shame and make
our lives miserable.

We  undertake  a  much  harder  task  when,  in  our
keen desire for knowledge, we strive to observe nat-
ural objects in and for themselves and in their rela-
tionship to one another, for we soon feel the lack of
the  standard  of  liking  and  disliking,  attraction  and


repulsion, usefulness and harmfulness, that came to
our aid when we were considering objects in rela-
tionship  to  our  human  selves.  We  are  forced  to
renounce this standard totally and, as dispassionate
and  quasi-divine  beings,  to  seek  out  and  examine
what is,  and  not  what  pleases  us.  This  means  that
neither  the  beauty  nor  the  usefulness  of  any  plant
should move true botanists, who rather should study
its  morphology  and  its  relationships  to  the  rest  of
the plant kingdom. Just as the sun shines equally on
all plants and entices them forth, so too should bota-
nists  observe  and  survey  them  all  impartially  and
take the data and standards for their assessment, not
from the human domain, but from the domain of the
things under observation.1

[2]

Goethe’s thoughts draw our attention to three different
kinds of things: first, the objects we constantly receive in-
formation about through the gateways of our senses, the
things  we  touch,  taste,  smell,  hear  and  see;  second,  the
impressions they make on us, which assume the character
of liking or disliking, desire or disgust, by virtue of the
fact that we react sympathetically to one thing and are re-
pelled  by  another,  or  find  one  thing  useful  and  another

The Essential Nature of the Human Being


harmful; and third, the knowledge we “quasi-divine be-
ings” acquire about the objects as they tell us the secrets
of what they are and how they work.

These three domains are distinctly separate in human
life, so we become aware that we are bound up with the
world in three different ways. The first way is something
we encounter and accept as a given fact; through the sec-
ond way, we turn the world into something that concerns
us and has significance for us; the third way we hold as a
goal to strive for unceasingly.

Why does the world appear to us in this threefold man-
ner? A simple example can make it clear. Suppose I walk
through  a  field  where  wildflowers  are  blooming.  The
flowers reveal their colors to me through my eyes—that is
the fact I accept as given. When I then take pleasure in the
wonderful  display  of  colors,  I  am  turning  the  fact  into
something that concerns me personally—that is, by means
of my feelings, I relate the flowers to my own existence. A
year later, when I go back to the same field, new flowers
are  there  and  they  arouse  new  joy  in  me.  The  previous
year’s enjoyment rises up as a memory; it is present in me
although  the  object  that  prompted  it  in  the  first  place  is
gone. And yet the flowers I am now seeing are of the same
species as last year’s and have grown in accordance with
the same laws. If I am familiar with this species and these
laws, I will recognize them again in this year’s flowers,
just as I did in last year’s. On reflection, I may realize that
since last year’s flowers are gone, my enjoyment of them
remains only in my memory; it is bound up with my per-
sonal existence alone. But what I recognized in the flowers


both last year and this year will remain  as  long  as  such
flowers grow; it is something that is revealed to me but is
not dependent on my existence in the same way that my
enjoyment is. My feelings of pleasure remain within me,
while  the  laws,  the  essence  of  the  flowers,  exist  in  the
world outside of me.

Thus, as human beings, we are constantly linking our-
selves to the things of the world in a threefold way. (We
should not read anything into this fact at first, but simply
take it as it stands.) It shows us that there are three as-
pects to our human nature. For the moment, this and only
this is what will be meant here by the three terms body,
soul and spirit.  Associating  any  preconceived  ideas  or
even hypotheses with these words will cause us to mis-
understand the discussion that follows. By body is meant
the means by which the things in our environment, such
as  the  wildflowers  in  the  example  above,  reveal  them-
selves  to  us.  The  word soul  designates  the  means  by
which  we  link  these  things  to  our  own  personal  exist-
ence,  by  which  we  experience  likes  and  dislikes,  plea-
sure and displeasure, joy and sorrow. By spirit is meant
what becomes apparent in us when, as “quasi-divine be-
ings,” to use Goethe’s expression, we look at the things
of the world. In this sense, each person consists of body,
soul and spirit.

Through the body, we are capable of linking ourselves
for the moment to things outside us. Through the soul, we
preserve the impressions things make on us. Through the
spirit, what the things themselves contain is disclosed to
us.  Only  when  we  look  at  the  human  being  from  these

[5]

[6]


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


three sides can we hope to understand our true nature, for
these three sides show us that we are related to the rest of
the world in a threefold way.

Through  the  body,  we  are  related  to  the  things  that
present themselves to our senses from outside. The sub-
stances  of  the  outer  world  make  up  the  body,  and  the
forces of the outer world are active in it. We can observe
our own bodily existence with our senses, just as we ob-
serve the things of the outside world, but it is not possible
to observe our soul existence in the same way. With my
bodily  senses,  I  can  observe  the  whole  range  of  bodily
processes taking place in me, but neither I nor anyone else
can perceive my likes and dislikes or my joys and sorrows
with bodily senses. The domain of the soul is inaccessible
to bodily perception. Our bodily existence is there for all
to see, but we carry our soul existence inside us as our
own private world. Through the spirit, however, the outer
world is revealed to us in a higher way. Although it is true
that the secrets of the outer world disclose themselves in-
side us, in the spirit we step outside of ourselves and let
the things themselves tell us what is significant for them,
rather than for us. When we look up at the starry sky, the
soul’s experience of delight belongs to us, but the eternal
laws of the stars, which we may grasp in thought and in
spirit, do not belong to us. They belong to the stars.

Thus as human beings we are citizens of three worlds.
In body, we both belong to and perceive the outer world;
in soul, we build up our own inner world; and in spirit, a
third world that is higher than both of the others reveals
itself to us.

[7]

[8]


[9]

It should be apparent that, because of the fundamental
differences between these three worlds, we will achieve a
clear understanding of them and of our own part in them
only by applying three different modes of observation.

[10]

[11]

I. The Bodily Nature of the Human Being

We learn about the human body by means of our bodily
senses, and our mode of observation can be no different
than  if  we  were  learning  about  other  sense-perceptible
things. We can observe the human being in the same way
that we observe minerals, plants and animals, and as hu-
man beings, we are related to these three other forms of
existence. Like the minerals, we build up our bodies out
of natural substances; like the plants, we grow and repro-
duce; like the animals, we perceive the objects around us
and develop inner experiences based on the impressions
they make on us. Therefore, we may attribute a mineral,
a plant and an animal existence to the human being.

The structural differences between minerals, plants and
animals  correspond  to  their  three  modes  of  existence.
Their structure or Gestalt (form) is what we can perceive
with our senses, and this alone is what may be called “the
body.” The human body, however, is different from the
animal body. We all recognize this difference, no matter
what we may think about how humans are related to ani-
mals. Even the most radical materialist, who denies the
existence of anything having to do with the soul, would
be hard put to disagree with the following statement by


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


Carus in his Organon of the Knowledge of Nature and the
Spirit:

Even  though  the  most  delicate  inner  construc-
tion  of  the  nervous  system  and  especially  of  the
brain remains an unsolved riddle for physiologists
and  anatomists,  it  is  an  undisputed  fact  that  the
concentration  of  its  structures  increases  in  the
higher  orders  of  animals,  reaching  in  the  human
being a level not to be found in any other creature.
This fact, of the greatest signiﬁcance with regard to
human  intellectual  development,  may  in  itself  be
sufﬁcient  to  explain  that  development.  Therefore,
when the structure of the brain has not developed
properly  and  shows  itself  to  be  small  and  inade-
quate as is the case in microcephalics and idiots, it
goes without saying that we can no more expect to
ﬁnd  understanding  and  the  appearance  of  original
ideas  than  we  can  expect  the  continuation  of  the
species  to  be  accomplished  by  individuals  with
totally  deformed  reproductive  organs.  In  contrast,
although it may not in itself guarantee genius, the
strong  and  beautifully  developed  structure  of  the
whole  person  and  of  the  brain  in  particular  is  at
least  the  ﬁrst  and  indispensable  prerequisite  of
higher knowledge.2

2. Carl Gustav Carus, 1789-1869, German naturalist, physician, psy-
chologist and landscape painter. From the chapter “On Knowledge” in
Organon der Erkenntnis der Natur und des Geistes [“Organon of the
Knowledge of Nature and the Spirit”], Leipzig, 1856, p. 89ff.


[12]

[13]


Just as we attribute mineral, plant and animal modes of
existence to the human body, we must also attribute to it
a fourth and distinctively human mode. Through the min-
eral mode of existence we are related to everything visi-
ble, through the plant-like mode to everything that grows
and reproduces, and through the animal mode to all crea-
tures that perceive their environment and have inner ex-
periences  based  on  outer  impressions.  But  through  the
human mode, even with regard to the physical body, we
make up a kingdom that is ours alone.

II. The Soul Nature of the Human Being

As an individual private inner world, soul nature is dif-
ferent  from  bodily  nature.  Its  intrinsic  privateness  be-
comes apparent as soon as we turn our attention to the
simplest act of sensing. We cannot know whether or not
others  experience  this  simple  sensation  in  exactly  the
same  way.  We  know  that  some  people  are  color-blind
and experience things only in different shades of gray,
while  others  are  partially  color-blind  and  cannot  per-
ceive certain gradations of color. The image of the world
that  their  eyes  provide  is  different  from  that  of  a  so-
called  normal  person.  The  same  applies  to  the  other
senses, too, more or less. This is already enough to dem-
onstrate that even a simple sensation belongs to the pri-
vate inner world. With my bodily senses, I can perceive
the same red table that someone else perceives, but I can-
not  perceive  that  person’s  sensation  of  red.  Therefore,


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


we must describe this sensation as belonging to the soul.
Once we are quite clear about this, we will stop looking
at  inner  experiences  as  mere  brain  processes  or  some-
thing of that sort.

Feeling follows closely on sensation, with one sensa-
tion  arousing  pleasure  in  us  and  another  displeasure.
These are the stirrings of our inner soul life. We each cre-
ate an inner world of feelings in addition to the world that
works in on us from outside. Then there is a third factor,
our will, through which we work back upon the outside
world, leaving the imprint of our own inner being on it. In
will activity, the soul flows outward, in a sense. The fact
that  our  actions  bear  the  stamp  of  our  inner  life  distin-
guishes them from natural events taking place in the outer
world. In this way the soul sets itself up as something per-
sonal and private in contrast to the world outside. It re-
ceives  stimuli  from  the  outer  world,  but  constructs  an
inner private world in accordance with them. Bodily ex-
istence becomes the basis for soul existence.

III. The Spirit Nature of the Human Being

The soul element in a human being is not determined ex-
clusively by the body. We do not wander aimlessly and
without direction from one sense impression to another,
nor do we respond to every random stimulus that acts on
us from outside or through our bodily processes. Instead,
we think about our sensations and our actions. By thinking
about  our  sensations,  we  come  to  an  understanding  of

[14]


things; by thinking about our actions, we create a rational
coherence  in  our  lives.  And  we  know  that  we  are  only
worthily fulfilling our tasks as human beings when we let
ourselves be guided by the right thoughts, both in know-
ing and in acting. Therefore, the human soul faces a dual
necessity. Out of natural necessity, it is governed by the
laws of the body, but  because it freely recognizes their ne-
cessity it also allows itself to be governed by the laws that
lead to correct thinking. Nature subjects us to the laws of
metabolism, but as human beings we subject ourselves to
the laws of thought.

Through this process, we make ourselves members of
a  higher  order  than  the  one  we  belong  to  through  the
body.  This  is  the  spiritual  order.  Soul  is  different  from
spirit, as different as it is from the body. As long as we
simply speak of the particles of carbon, hydrogen, oxy-
gen and nitrogen moving around in our body, we do not
have the soul in view. The life of the soul begins only at
the point where sensation arises within such movement,
where we taste something sweet or feel pleasure. In the
same way, we do not have the spirit in view as long as we
consider only the inner experiences that pass through us
when  we  give  ourselves  completely  to  the  outer  world
and to the life of the body. Rather, this soul existence is
the basis for the spiritual, just as bodily existence is the
basis for soul existence. The natural scientist (biologist)
deals with the body, the soul scientist (psychologist) with
the soul, and the spiritual scientist with the spirit. Anyone
trying to understand  the  essential  nature  of  the  human
being  by  means  of  thinking  is  first  required  to  come,


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


through  self-reflection,  to  a  clear  understanding  of  the
difference between body, soul and spirit.

IV. Body, Soul, and Spirit

The only valid way for us to shed light on ourselves as hu-
man  beings  is  by  clearly  grasping  the  significance  of
thinking within our overall being. The bodily instrument
of thinking is the brain. We can see colors only by means
of  a  well-formed  eye;  similarly,  only  an  appropriately
constructed brain can serve the purpose of thinking. The
whole human body is built up in such a way that the brain,
the organ of the spirit, is its crowning glory. We can un-
derstand the structure of the human brain only when we
look at it in relationship to its function, which is to serve
as the bodily basis for the thinking spirit. This is demon-
strated by a comparative survey of the animal kingdom:
In amphibians the brain is relatively small in proportion
to the spinal cord, in mammals it is larger, and in humans
it is largest of all in proportion to the rest of the body.

Numerous  prejudices  prevail  against  observations
about thinking such as those being made here. Many peo-
ple tend to underestimate thinking and to place more val-
ue  on  the  warmth  and  depth  of  feelings  or  sensations.
They even claim that it is not through sober thinking but
through the warmth of feelings, through the direct power
of sensations, that we ascend to higher knowledge. These
people are afraid that clear thinking will deaden their feel-
ings.  This  is  certainly  true  of  mundane  thinking  that  is

[15]

[16]


[17]

[18]


concerned only with utilitarian things, but exactly the op-
posite is true of thoughts that lead to higher levels of ex-
istence.  No  feeling  and  no  enthusiasm  on  earth  can
compare with the sensations of warmth, beauty and exal-
tation that are enkindled by pure, crystal-clear thoughts
relating to higher worlds. Our loftiest feelings are not the
ones  that  happen  by  themselves,  but  the  ones  achieved
through strenuous and energetic thinking.

The human body is built up in such a way that it meets
the requirements of thinking; that is, the same substances
and forces that are also present in the mineral kingdom
are put together in the human body in a way that allows
thinking to appear. For purposes of the following discus-
sion, we will call this mineral structure, formed in accor-
dance with its function, “the physical body” of the human
being.

This  mineral  structure,  organized  with  the  brain  as  its
center, comes about through reproduction and achieves its
mature form through growth. Reproduction and growth are
characteristics  that  human  beings  have  in  common  with
plants and animals; they distinguish a living being from a
lifeless mineral. Living things develop out of other living
things by means of the reproductive cells; descendants are
linked to their ancestors in the succession of generations.
The forces through which a mineral comes into being are
directed  toward  the  substances  composing  it—a  quartz
crystal takes shape through forces inherent in the silicon
and oxygen combined in it. But the forces that shape an
oak tree must be looked for indirectly in the reproductive
cells of the parent plants. Through reproduction, the form


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


of the oak is maintained and passed on from ancestor to de-
scendant in accordance with the inner, inborn dictates of
life. People had a crude view of nature indeed when they
believed that lower animals and even fish could take shape
out of mud. A living being’s form is reproduced through
heredity,  and  how  it  develops  depends  on  the  parents  it
came from, or, in other words, on the species it belongs to.
The substances that make it up are continually changing,
but its species remains constant throughout its lifetime and
is passed on to its descendants through heredity. The spe-
cies is therefore what determines how the substances are
put together. We will call the species-determining force the
life  force.3  Just  as  mineral  forces  express  themselves  in
crystals, the formative life force expresses itself in the spe-
cies, or forms, of plant and animal life.

As human beings, we perceive mineral forces by means
of  our  bodily  senses.  We  can  only  perceive  things  for
which we possess the corresponding bodily sense. Without

3. Not too long ago any mention of a “life force” or “vital force” was
taken as an indication of an unscientiﬁc mind. Here and there, how-
ever, we now begin to meet scientists who are no longer opposed to
the idea of a vital force as it was understood in times past. But if we
examine the progress of modern scientiﬁc thought, we ﬁnd that those
who refuse to acknowledge the existence of a vital force are more con-
sistent in their logic, and it is certainly true that this life force does not
belong to what we currently call “the forces of nature.” In fact, anyone
who is unwilling to dispense with modern science’s habitual concepts
and ways of thinking and to make the step to a higher mode of think-
ing should refrain from using the term at all. Only spiritual scientiﬁc
presuppositions and a spiritual scientiﬁc way of thinking make it pos-
sible to approach such things without being self-contradictory.

[19]


the eye there would be no perception of light, without the
ear no perception of sound. Of those senses present in hu-
man beings, only a kind of sense of touch is possessed by
the very  lowest  organisms;  for  them,  only  the  mineral
forces perceptible to this sense are perceived in the way
human  senses  perceive  them.4  The  degree  to  which  the

3. (continued) Current  theorists  who  are  attempting  to  come  to
purely scientiﬁc conclusions have abandoned the belief (prevalent in
the second half of the nineteenth century) that the phenomena of life
can  be  explained  solely  in  terms  of  forces  that  are  also  at  work  in
inanimate nature. Noted naturalist Oskar Hertwig’s book refuting the
Darwinian  theory  of  chance  is  a  scientiﬁc  phenomenon  that  sheds
light far and near. (Oskar Hertwig, 1849-1922, zoologist; professor
in Berlin from 1888-1921. The book referred to is Das Werden der
Organismen.  Eine  Widerlegung  von  Darwins  Zufallstheorie  [The
Development  of  Organisms:  A  Refutation  of  Darwin’s  Theory  of
Chance]).It challenges the assumption that the interworking of mere
physical and chemical laws is sufﬁcient to give rise to life. Also sig-
niﬁcant  is  the  so-called  neovitalist  viewpoint  which,  like  the  older
“vital  force”  theory,  admits  the  possibility  of  forces  unique  to  life.
However, we cannot get beyond abstract schematic concepts in this
ﬁeld  unless  we  recognize  that  to  grasp  the  aspect  of  life  that  tran-
scends the activity of inorganic forces, we must use a mode of per-
ception that rises to supersensible vision. When we enter the realm of
life,  it  is  not  enough  simply  to  continue  to  apply  the  methods  of
understanding  we  have  always  applied  to  the  inorganic  world.  A
whole new way of knowing is needed.
4.4. Here,  the  “sense  of  touch”  of  lower  organisms  is  not  the  same
thing as what the term usually means in descriptions of the “senses,”
and in fact, from the point of view of spiritual science, a lot can be
said against the use of the term in this context. In this case, “sense of
touch”  means  becoming  generally  aware  of  an  impression  coming
from outside, as opposed to acquiring a speciﬁc awareness that con-
sists in seeing, hearing, and so on.


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


other senses of higher animals have developed determines
the richness and variety of their surroundings for them, the
surroundings that human beings also perceive. Therefore,
the organs that a living being possesses determine whether
or not something present in the environment is also present
for it as a perception or a sensation. For instance, what is
present in the air as a certain kind of movement becomes
the sensation of sound for human beings.

We do not perceive the manifestations of the life force
by  means  of  our  ordinary  senses.  We  see  the  colors  of
plants and smell their fragrance, but the life force is con-
cealed from this kind of observation. However, our ordi-
nary senses have as little right to deny the existence of the
life force as a person born blind has to deny the existence
of colors. Colors are present for a blind person after a suc-
cessful eye operation, and in the same way the plant and
animal  species—not  just  the  individual  plants  and  ani-
mals—created by the life force are also present for those
whose corresponding organ has opened up. A whole new
world is disclosed to us once this organ has opened. From
that point on, we perceive not only the colors, scents and
so forth of living things, we perceive their very life itself.
In every plant and animal, we perceive the life-filled spir-
itual form in addition to the physical form. Since we need
a name for this spirit form, we will call it the ether body
or life body.

For investigators of spiritual life, the ether body is not
merely  a  result  of  the  physical  body’s  substances  and
forces, but a real, independent entity that calls these same
substances  and  forces  to  life.  Speaking  in  the  sense  of


spiritual science, we might put it like this: A body that is
merely material—for example, a crystal—owes its form
to the physical formative forces inherent in lifeless mat-
ter; a living body, however, cannot owe its form to these
same forces, since it starts to decay immediately once life
has abandoned it and it has been surrendered to physical
forces alone.5 The life body is present at every moment of

5.5. For a long time after compiling this book, I also spoke of what is
here termed “ether body” or “life body” as “the body of formative
forces.” I felt compelled to give it this name because I believed one
could  not  do  enough  to  try  to  prevent  the  identiﬁcation  of  what  I
meant with the “life force” or “vital force” of an earlier stage of sci-
ence.  When  it  comes  to  refuting  this  outdated  concept,  as  modern
science does, I agree in some respects with those who would deny
the existence of any such force. That term was used in an attempt to
explain  the  unique  way  of  working  that  inorganic  forces  took  on
within a living organism. However, inorganic activity is actually no
different  inside  an  organism  than  it  is  outside  in  inorganic  nature.
Within  an  organism  there  is  simply  something  additional  present,
something that is not inorganic, namely the formative activity of life
whose basis is the ether body or body of formative forces. Recogniz-
ing the existence of the ether body in no way impinges on the legiti-
mate task of science, which is to trace the effects of forces observed
in inorganic nature into the world of living organisms. Spiritual sci-
ence, however, also ﬁnds it justiﬁed not to imagine these effects as
altered by a particular “vital force” within an organism. A spiritual
researcher speaks of an ether body at the point where an organism
discloses something that a lifeless object cannot.

In spite of all this, I do not ﬁnd it necessary to replace the term
“ether body” with “body of formative forces” in this book, since in
this context anyone who so chooses will be able to avoid misunder-
standing. Misunderstanding will only arise if this term is used in an
incompatible context.


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


life  as  an  entity  that  constantly  maintains  the  physical
body against decay. In order to see this life body, to per-
ceive  it  in  another  living  being,  we  need  the  awakened
spiritual eye. We may be able to deduce the existence of
the  ether  body  on  logical  grounds  without  this  spiritual
eye, but we can “see” it with the spiritual eye, just as we
see colors with the physical eye. Please do not take of-
fense  at  the  term  “ether  body,”  but  take  it  simply  as  a
name for what is described here. “Ether” as the word is
used here means something different from the hypotheti-
cal ether of nineteenth-century physics.

In its structure, the human ether body, like the human
physical body, is an image of its function. It too can be un-
derstood only in relation to the thinking spirit. The human
ether body differs from that of plants and animals in being
organized to support the thinking spirit. Just as we belong
to the mineral world through our physical body, we be-
long  to  the  world  of  life  through  our  ether  body.  After
death,  the  physical  body  disintegrates  into  the  mineral
world,  the  ether  body  into  the  world  of  life.  The  term
“body” is used here to designate what gives a being of any
kind its form, shape or Gestalt. It should not be confused
with the sense-perceptible form of the material body. As
used in this book, the term “body” can also refer to some-
thing that takes on form in soul or in spirit.

The life body is still something external to us, but with
the first stirrings of sensation our inner self responds to the
stimuli of the outer world. No matter how far we pursue
what  we  justifiably  call  the  “external  world,”  we  will
never be able to find sensation. Rays of light penetrate into

[20]


the  eye,  to  the  retina,  where  they  stimulate  chemical
changes in what is called the visual purple in the rods of
the retina. The effect of this stimulus then moves along
the visual nerve to the brain, where further physical pro-
cesses take place. If we could actually observe this hap-
pening,  we  would  simply  see  physical  processes  like
those that take place anywhere else in the external world.
But if we are able to observe the ether body, we will per-
ceive how a physical process taking place in the brain is
also  a  life  process.  However,  the  sensation  of  the  blue
color that the recipient of the light rays experiences is still
nowhere to be found; it only comes about in the recipi-
ent’s soul. If the recipient’s constitution consisted only of
the physical body and the ether body, sensation could not
take place. The activity through which sensation becomes
a fact fundamentally differs from the working of the for-
mative life force and elicits from it an inner experience.
Without  this  activity, our  response  to  external  stimuli
would be nothing more than a mere life process such as
those we observe in plants. Picture human beings receiv-
ing impressions from all sides. Our sensations respond to
all these impressions, so we also picture ourselves as the
source  of  the  sentient  activity  described  above,  which
moves  out  in  all  the  directions  from  which  we  receive
impressions. We will call this source of activity the sen-
tient soul. It is just as real as the physical body. If a per-
son stands before me and I disregard his or her sentient
soul, imagining that person merely as a physical body, it
is as if I were imagining a painting as nothing more than
its canvas.


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


With regard to perceiving the sentient soul, we must
say something similar to what was said earlier about the
ether body. Our bodily organs are blind to the sentient
soul, and so is the organ by which life can be perceived
as life, by which the ether body can be perceived. But
by means of a still higher organ, the inner world of sen-
sations  can  become  a  particular  kind  of  supersensible
perception. As we develop this organ, we become able
not  only  to  sense  the  impressions  of  the  physical  and
ether worlds, but also to see the sensations as such. At
that point, another being’s world of sensations is spread
out before us like any outer reality. We must differenti-
ate between experiencing our own world of sensations
and perceiving that of someone else—of course anyone
can look into his or her own personal world of sensa-
tions, but only a seer with an opened “spiritual eye” can
see the inner sensations of another being. Unless we are
seers, we can know the world of sensation only as some-
thing within ourselves, as the personal and hidden expe-
riences of our own souls, but when our “spiritual eye” is
open, what otherwise lives hidden inside another being
shines forth, accessible to our outward-looking spiritual
gaze.

To avoid misunderstanding, it should be expressly stat-
ed that a seer does not inwardly experience the content of
the inner worlds of sensations belonging to other beings.
These beings experience their perceptions and sensations
from their own inner points of view, while the seer per-
ceives a manifestation or expression of each one’s world
of sensations.

[21]

[23]


In its functioning, the sentient soul is dependent on the
ether body, because it draws from the ether body what it
then allows to light up as sensation. And since the ether
body is the life within the physical body, the sentient soul
is indirectly dependent on the physical body as well. Only
a properly functioning and well-formed eye makes accu-
rate color sensations possible. This is how the bodily na-
ture  affects  the  sentient  soul.  The  sentient  soul  is  thus
determined and restricted in its  activity by  the  physical
body, and lives within the limits set by our bodily nature.
That is, the physical body, which is built up out of mineral
substances and enlivened by the ether body, in turn sets
the  limits  for  our  sentient  soul.  Those  who  possess  the
above-mentioned  organ  for  “seeing”  the  sentient  soul
therefore recognize it as having limits set by the body.

However, the boundaries of the sentient soul do not co-
incide with those of the material physical body. The sen-
tient soul extends beyond the physical body, even though
the  force  that  determines  its  limits  proceeds  from  the
physical body. This means that still another distinct mem-
ber of the human  constitution inserts itself  between  the
physical and ether bodies on the one hand and the sentient
soul on the other. This is the sentient or soul body. To say
it another way, a portion of the ether body is finer than the
rest,  and  this  finer  part  forms  a  unity  with  the  sentient
soul, while the coarser part forms a kind of unity with the
physical  body.  However,  the  sentient  soul  extends  be-
yond the soul body.

[24]

For simplicity sake, we have chosen the term “sentient
soul,” which is related to “sensing.” But in fact, “sensing”


[25]

The Essential Nature of the Human Being


is  only  one  aspect  of  the  soul’s  being.  Our  feelings  of
pleasure  and  displeasure,  our  drives,  instincts  and  pas-
sions,  are  all  very  close  to  our  sensations.  They  are  all
similarly private and individual in character and similarly
dependent on our bodily nature.

Our sentient soul interacts with thinking, with the spirit,
just  as  it  does  with  the  body.  To  begin  with,  thinking
serves the sentient soul: we formulate thoughts about our
sensations and thus explain the outer world to ourselves.
For instance, a child who has been burned thinks about it
and  arrives  at  the  conclusion  that  fire  burns.  We  do  not
blindly pursue our drives, instincts and passions; we think
about  them,  thus  creating  opportunities  to  gratify  them.
This is the direction taken by our material culture, which
is the sum of the services rendered to the sentient soul by
thinking. Vast amounts of thoughtpower are directed to-
ward this end. Thoughtpower has created ships, railroads,
telegraphs  and  telephones—all  things  that  for  the  most
part serve to satisfy the needs of sentient souls.

We have seen how the formative life force pervades the
physical body. In a similar way, thoughtpower pervades
the  sentient  soul.  The  formative  life  force  connects  the
physical body to its ancestors and descendants and thus
places it in the context of natural laws having nothing to
do with mere minerals. Similarly, thoughtpower gives the
soul a place within a system of laws to which it does not
belong as mere sentient soul.


Through the sentient soul, we are related to the animals,
in  whom  we  can  also  recognize  the  presence  of  sensa-
tions, drives, instincts and passions. Animals,  however,
follow these up directly without interweaving them with
independent  thoughts  that  transcend  immediate  experi-
ence.6 This is also the case  to a certain extent with less
developed human beings. As such, therefore, the sentient
soul is different from the more highly evolved part of the
soul that places thinking in its service. We may call this
soul, which is served by thinking, the mind soul.

6.  Spiritual  scientiﬁc  statements  must  be  taken  very  exactly,
because they are of value only if the ideas are expressed precisely.
For example, take the sentence, “. . . animals follow these [percep-
tions,  instincts,  etc.]  up  directly  without  interweaving  them  with
independent  thoughts  that  go  beyond  their  immediate  experi-
ence. . . .” If the modiﬁers “independent” and “that go beyond their
immediate experience” are not fully taken into account, it would be
easy  to  make  the  mistake  of  assuming  that  what  is  meant  here  is
that no thoughts are present in the sensations and instincts of ani-
mals.  However,  true  spiritual  science  is  based  on  the  recognition
that the inner experience of animals, like everything else in exist-
ence, is permeated with thoughts, although these thoughts are not
those of an independent “I” living within each animal. Instead, they
belong to a collective animal ego that must be seen as a being that
governs  the  individual  animals  from  outside.  This  collective  ego,
unlike the human “I,” is not present in the physical world but works
on the animals from the soul world described on pp. 93ff. (Further
details  may  be  found  in An  Outline  of  Occult  Science  by  this
author.)  The  point here is that in human beings, thoughts acquire
an independent existence; that is, we can have a direct soul experi-
ence of them as thoughts rather than experiencing them indirectly
in sensation.


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


The  mind  soul  permeates  the  sentient  soul.  Anyone
who possesses the organ for “seeing” the soul will see the
mind  soul  as  an  entity  distinct  from  the  mere  sentient
soul.7

Through thinking, we are led beyond our own personal
lives;  we  acquire  something  that  extends  beyond  our
own souls. We take it as a matter of course that the laws
of thinking correspond with the universal order. We can
feel at home in the universe because this correspondence
exists, and it is a weighty factor in learning to recognize
our own essential nature. We seek the truth in our soul;
through this truth, not only the soul but also the things of
the world express themselves. Truth recognized through
thinking has an independent significance, which refers to
the things of the world and not merely to our own souls.
In  my  delight  in  the  starry  heavens,  I  am  living  inside
myself, but the thoughts that I formulate about the orbits
of the heavenly bodies have the same meaning for any-
one  else’s  thinking  as  they  have  for  mine.  It  would  be

7. Translator’s note: It is important to note that Rudolf Steiner here
uses both the terms Verstandesseele (mind soul or rational soul) and
Gemütsseele, “heart-and-mind soul,” even equating Verstandesseele
with that untranslatable German concept, Gemüt. In this context, the
relationship  of  the  mind-soul  to Gemüt  even  in  its  non-anthropo-
sophical usage (warm-heartedness, kindly disposition), as well as to
Gemütlichkeit (comfort, coziness) is apparent.


senseless to speak of “my” delight and pleasure if I my-
self were not present, but it is not at all senseless to talk
about my thoughts without reference to me as a person.
The truth I think today was also true yesterday and will
be true tomorrow, even though it occupies my mind only
for  today.  If  understanding  something  gives  me  plea-
sure, this pleasure is meaningful only as long as it is ac-
tive  in  me,  but  the  truth  of  the  understanding  has  a
significance  totally  independent  of  my  pleasure.  In
grasping the truth, the soul links up with something that
possesses intrinsic value, a value that neither appears nor
disappears with the soul’s perception of it. The real truth
neither  comes  into  being  nor  passes  away;  its  signifi-
cance cannot be destroyed.

This is in no way contradicted by the fact that certain
human “truths” are of only temporary value because they
are recognized as partial or total errors in due time. We
must realize that the truth, in itself, endures, even though
our thoughts are only transient manifestations of eternal
truths. Even if, like Lessing, we say that we are content
to strive eternally for the truth since the pure and perfect
truth can surely exist only for a god, this does not deny
the  eternal  value  of  the  truth,  but  rather  confirms  it.8
Only something of eternal and intrinsic significance can
evoke an eternal striving and be the object of an eternal
search. If the truth were not wholly independent in itself,
if  its  value  and  significance  came  from  the  feelings  of
human souls, then it could not be a goal agreed on by all

The Essential Nature of the Human Being


humankind.  The  very  fact  that  we  all  strive  for  it  con-
firms its independent nature.

This applies equally to what is truly good. What is mor-
ally right is independent of our inclinations and passions
insofar as it does not submit to them but makes them sub-
mit to it. Desire and revulsion, likes and dislikes, are the
property of each individual human soul, but duty stands
higher than likes and dislikes, sometimes standing so high
in people’s estimation that they will give up their lives for
it. The more we have ennobled our inclinations, our likes
and dislikes, so that they submit without force or compul-
sion to what we recognize as our duty, the higher we stand
as human beings. What is morally right, like what is true,
has an intrinsic eternal value that it does not receive from
the sentient soul.

By letting what is intrinsically true and good come to
life within us, we rise above the mere sentient soul. The
eternal spirit shines into the sentient soul, kindling in it a
light  that  will  never  go  out.  To  the  extent  that  our  soul
lives in this light, it takes part in something eternal, which
it links to its own existence. What the soul carries within
itself as truth and goodness is immortal. We will call this
eternal  element  that  lights  up  within  the  soul  the  con-
sciousness soul.

We can speak of consciousness even in connection with
the soul’s lower stirrings; even the most mundane sen-
sation is already the object of consciousness, and to this
extent  animals  must  also  be  credited  with  having  con-
sciousness. But the very core of human consciousness, the
“soul within the soul,” so to speak, is what “consciousness


[30]


soul” means here. The consciousness soul is different from
the mind soul, which is still entangled in sensations, drives,
emotions  and  so  forth.  We  all  know  how  we  accept  our
personal  preferences  as  true,  at  first.  But  truth  is  lasting
only when it has freed itself from any flavor of such sym-
pathies and antipathies. The truth is true, even if all our per-
sonal  feelings  revolt  against  it.  We  will  apply  the  term
“consciousness soul” to that part of the soul in which truth
lives.

Thus the soul, like the body, consists of three distinct
members—the sentient soul, the mind soul, and the con-
sciousness soul. Just as our bodily nature works from be-
low upwards to set limits on the soul, spirituality works
from above downwards to expand it. The more our soul is
filled with what is true and good, the broader and more in-
clusive its eternal aspect becomes.

For anyone who can “see” the soul, the glow that pro-
ceeds from a human being whose eternal aspect is expand-
ing is as real as a flame’s radiant light is to the physical
eye. To the seer, the visible bodily person is only a part of
the whole human being, the coarsest structure in the midst
of others that interpenetrate it and each other. The ether
body as a life form fills out the physical body, and beyond
the ether body we can distinguish the soul body or astral
form projecting outward on all sides. Extending beyond
this is the sentient soul, and then the mind soul that grows
ever larger as it takes in ever more of the true and the good.
If people lived solely out of their own inclinations, likes
and dislikes, the boundaries of their mind souls would co-
incide with those of their sentient souls.


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


This  formation,  in  the  midst  of  which  the  physical
body can be seen as if in a cloud, can be called the human
aura.  When  the  essential  nature  of  the  human  being  is
seen in the way that this book attempts to describe, it is
supplemented and enriched by the measure of the aura.

In the course of our early development, a moment ar-
rives when, for the first time in our lives, each of us expe-
riences  him-  or  herself  as  an  independent  being  face  to
face with the rest of the world. For sensitive people, this
is a significant experience. In his autobiography, the poet
Jean Paul recounts this moment:

[31]

Although  I  have  never  told  anyone  about  it,  I
will never forget the experience of being present at
the  birth  of  my  self-awareness.  I  can  tell  you  the
place and time exactly. One morning when I was a
very  small  child,  I  was  standing  in  the  front  door
looking toward the woodpile on the left, when sud-
denly the inner vision, “I am an I,” struck me like a
lightning bolt from heaven. It has gone on shining
ever since. My “I” had seen itself, for the ﬁrst time
and for all time. It is almost inconceivable that my
memory  could  deceive  me  on  this  point,  since  no
one else ever told me anything about it that I might
have  added  to.  It  was  an  incident  that  took  place
veiled in my human holiest of holies, and its very


novelty gave permanence to the mundane circum-
stances surrounding it.9

We all know that little children refer to themselves, by
saying  things  like  “Charlie’s  a  good  boy,”  or  “Mary
wants that,” and we find it appropriate that they should
speak  about  themselves  as  they  would  about  someone
else, since they are not yet aware of their own indepen-
dent  existence.  Consciousness  of  self  has  not  yet  been
born in them.10 Through this consciousness of self, an in-
dividual achieves self-definition as an independent being,
separate from everything else, as “I.”

By “I,” a person means the total experience of his or her
being as body and soul. Body and soul are the vehicles of
the “I”; it works in them. Just as the physical body has its
center in the brain, the soul has its center in the “I.” Our
sensations are stimulated from outside; our feelings assert
themselves as effects of the outer world; our will relates to

9.  Jean  Paul  Friedrich  Richter,  1763-1825.  He  ﬁrst  described  this
experience  in Wahrheit  aus  Jean  Pauls  Leben.  Kindheitsgeschichte
von  ihm  selbst  geschrieben  (The  True  Story  of  Jean  Paul’s  Life:  A
Childhood  Autobiography)[three  books  in  two  volumes],  Breslau,
1826-1828, Book I, p. 53.
10. We have noted that little children refer to themselves in the third
person.  What  is  important  here  is  not  how  early  children  use  the
word  “I,”  but  at  what  point  they  can  connect  the  appropriate  idea
with the word. Children may well hear the word from adults and then
use it without grasping the idea “I.” In general, however, they start to
use the word relatively late, and this in itself points to an important
fact of development, namely that the idea “I” gradually unfolds out
of a vague feeling of “I.”


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


the  outer  world  by  manifesting  in  outward-directed  ac-
tions. Our “I,” however, our actual individual essence, re-
mains invisible. It is very telling that Jean Paul describes
becoming aware of his “I” as “an incident. . .veiled in [the]
human holiest of holies,” because we are each totally alone
with our own “I.” This “I” is the self of each human being.
We are justified in seeing the “I” as our true being, and
may therefore describe body and soul as the “garments” in
which we live, as the bodily conditions under which we
act. In the course of our development we learn to use these
instruments more and more as servants of our “I.”

This little word “I,” as it is used in our language, is a
name different from all other names. Appropriate reflec-
tion on the nature of this name opens up an approach to
understanding human nature in a deeper sense. Any other
name can be applied to the corresponding object by all of
us in the same way. Everyone can call a table “table” and
a chair “chair.” But this is not the case with the name “I.”
No one can use it to mean someone else; each of us can
only call him- or herself “I.” The name “I,” if it desig-
nates me, can never reach my ear from outside. The soul
can only designate itself as “I” from within, through it-
self. Thus, when we say “I” to ourselves, something be-
gins to speak in us that has nothing to do with any of the
worlds from which the above-mentioned “garments” are
taken.

The “I” gains an ever-increasing mastery over body and
soul, and this is expressed in a person’s aura. The greater
the mastery, the more differentiated, complex and richly
colored the aura becomes. How the “I” affects the aura is


visible  to  the  seer,  but  the  “I”  itself  is  not;  it  is  truly
“veiled in [the] human holiest of holies.”

The “I” takes in the rays of the light that shines as eter-
nal light in each human being. Just as we gather up ex-
periences  of  body  and  soul  in  the  “I,”  we  also  allow
thoughts  of  truth  and goodness   to flow  into  it.  Sense-
perceptible phenomena reveal themselves to our “I” from
one  side,  the  spirit  from  the  other.  Body  and  soul  give
themselves over to the “I” in order to serve it, but the “I”
gives itself over to the spirit in order to be filled by it. The
“I” lives within the body and the soul, but the spirit lives
within the “I.” What there is of spirit in the “I” is eternal,
for the “I” receives its nature and significance from what-
ever it is united with. To the extent that it dwells in a phys-
ical body, it is subject to mineral laws; through the ether
body it is subject to the laws governing reproduction and
growth; by virtue of the sentient and mind souls it is sub-
ject to the laws of the soul world. And to the extent that it
receives the spiritual into itself, it is subject to the laws of
the spirit. What is formed in accordance with mineral laws
and the laws of life comes into existence and passes away
again; the spirit, however, has nothing to do with becom-
ing and perishing.

The “I” dwells in the soul. Although the highest mani-
festation of the “I” belongs to the consciousness soul, it is
also true that the “I” radiates outward from there, filling
the  entire  soul  and  exerting  its  influence  on  the  body


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


through the soul. And within the “I,” the spirit is alive and
active. The spirit streams into the “I,” taking it as its “gar-
ment” just as the “I” itself lives in the body and the soul.
The spirit shapes the “I” from the inside out and the min-
eral world shapes it from the outside in. We will call the
spirit that shapes an “I,” that lives as an “I,” the spirit self,
since it appears as the human “I” or “self.”

We can explain the difference between the spirit self and
the consciousness soul as follows: The consciousness soul
merely touches the autonomous truth that is independent
of all sympathy and antipathy, but the spirit self carries this
same truth inside itself, taken up, enclosed and individual-
ized by means of the “I” and taken into the individual’s in-
dependent  being.  Through  becoming  independent  and
uniting with the truth, the “I” itself achieves immortality.
The spirit self is a revelation of the spiritual world with-
in the “I,” just as a sense perception, coming from the oth-
er side, is a revelation of the physical world within the “I.”
In what is red, green, light, dark, hard, soft, warm or cold,
we  recognize  the  revelations  of  the  physical  world;  in
what  is  true  and  good,  the  revelations  of  the  spiritual
world.  Just  as  we  call  the  revelation  of  physical  things
“sensation,” we will call the revelation of spiritual things
“intuition.”11  Even  a  very  simple  thought  already  con-
tains intuition, because we cannot touch it with our hands

11. In my book How to Know Higher Worlds and in Occult Science,
the real nature of intuition is described. Casual readers could easily
imagine  a  discrepancy  between  how  this  term  is  used  in  those  two
books and its use here.

[33]


or  see  it  with  our  eyes;  we  must  receive  its  revelation
from the spirit by means of the “I.”

If a less developed and a more developed person look
at  the  same  plant,  something  quite  different  happens  in
the  “I”  of  the  first  than  in  the  “I”  of  the  second,  even
though the sensations of both have been prompted by the
same object. The difference is that one person can form
much more complete thoughts about the object than the
other. If objects revealed themselves only through sensa-
tion, there could be no progress in spiritual development.
Members of primitive cultures also experience nature, of
course, but natural laws become apparent only to the in-
tuition-fructified thinking of the more highly developed
person. Even children experience the stimuli of the outer
world as incentives to their will, but the dictates of what
is  morally  right  become  accessible  to  them  only  in  the
course of their development as they learn to live in the
spirit and understand its revelations.

Just as there would be no sensations of color without
the  eye,  there  would  also  be  no  intuitions  without  the
higher thinking of the spirit self. The sensation does not
create the plant on which the color appears, nor does in-
tuition create spiritual realities; it merely supplies infor-
mation about them.

11.  (continued)  However,  this  contradiction  does  not  exist  if  we
observe closely and note that that element from the spiritual world
that discloses itself in its full reality to spiritual perception by means
of intuition announces itself in its lowest manifestation to the spirit
self just as outer existence announces itself to the physical world by
means of sensation.

[34]


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


Through intuitions, the “I,” awakening in our soul, re-
ceives  messages  from  above,  from  the  spiritual  world,
just  as  it  receives  messages  from  the  physical  world
through sensations. In this way, the “I” makes the spiritu-
al world part of its personal soul life, just as it does with
the physical world by means of the senses. The soul, or
rather the “I” that is beginning to shine within it, opens its
doors on two sides, toward the physical world and toward
the spiritual.

The only way the physical world is able to make its pres-
ence known to our “I” is by building up, out of its own sub-
stances  and  forces,  a  body  in  which  a  conscious  soul  is
able to live and to take hold of the organs for perceiving
the external physical world. Similarly, the spiritual world,
with its spirit substances and spirit forces, builds up a spir-
itual body in which the “I” is able to live and to perceive
spiritual realities by means of intuitions. (Obviously, the
terms “spirit substance” and “spiritual body” are contra-
dictions in terms if taken literally. They are used here only
to  direct  our  thoughts  to  the  spiritual  entity  that  corre-
sponds to the physical human body.)

The physical body is built up within the physical world
as a completely separate being, and the same is true of the
spiritual  body  in  the  spiritual  world.  The  human  being
likewise  has  an  inside  and  an  outside  in  the  physical
world, and the same is true in the spiritual world. And just
as we take in substances from our physical surroundings
and incorporate them into our bodies, we also take in spir-
itual substance from our spiritual surroundings and make
it our own. This spiritual substance is eternal nourishment

for human beings. We are born out of the physical world,
and yet we are independent beings separate from the rest
of the physical world. In the same way, we are born out
of the spirit through the eternal laws of the good and the
true, and yet we are separate from the spiritual world out-
side us. We will call this independent spiritual entity the
“spirit body.”12

When  we  examine  a  physical  human  body,  we  find
the same substances and forces that  are found outside
it in the rest of the physical world. The same is true of
the  spirit  body—the  elements  of  the  outer  spiritual
world pulsate in it; the forces of the rest of the spiritual
world are active in it. In the physical world, a living and

[38]

12. Rudolf Steiner here uses the term Geistesmensch. Literally trans-
lated this means “spirit human being” or, as in previous translations,
“Spirit Man.” In theosophical language, and in the earliest editions of
Theosophy itself, it is called Atman (as the spirit-self is called Manas
and the Life-Spirit is called Budhi). It is clear from the present con-
text,  however,  and  from  the  conclusion—namely,  that  the  Geistes-
mensch or “spirit human being” is the physical body transformed by
the  “I”—that  “spirit  body”  is  actually  the  most  unambiguous  and
least  confusing  translation.  Cf. The  Spiritual  Hierarchies  and  their
Reﬂection  in  the  Physical  World,  p.  44:  “Outwardly  the  physical
body  appears  a  physical  body,  but  inwardly  it  is  completely  con-
trolled and permeated by the ‘I’. At this stage, the physical body is
both physical body and Atman.” Also, The Gospel of St. John, p 36:
“[The Human being] will ﬁnally reach the point where, by means of
the ‘I’ he [or she] will transform the physical body also. That part of
the physical body which is transformed by the ‘I’ is called Atman or
Spirit  Man.”  And  p.  116:  “.  .  .and  the  physical  body  will  be  so
greatly  metamorphosed  that  it  will,  at  the  same  time,  be  as  truly  a
Spirit Man, Atman, as it is now a physical body.”


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


sentient being is closed off within a physical skin, and
the  same  applies  to  the  spiritual  world.  A  membrane
closes off the spirit body from the undifferentiated spir-
itual  world  and  makes  the  spirit  body  a  self-contained
spiritual being within that world, a being that intuitively
perceives the spiritual content of the universe. We will
call this spiritual membrane the spiritual skin or “auric
membrane.” We must keep in mind, however, that this
spiritual  skin  is  constantly  expanding  to  accommodate
human development, and that the spiritual individuality
of a human being (the auric membrane) is capable of un-
limited expansion.

Inside  the  spiritual  skin,  the  spirit  body  is  alive;  it  is
built up by a spiritual life force in the same sense that the
physical body is built up by a physical life force. There-
fore,  just  as  we  speak  of  an  ether  body,  we  must  also
speak of an ether spirit for the spirit body. We will call
this ether spirit the life spirit. The spiritual constitution of
the human being is thus subdivided into three members,
the spirit body, the life spirit, and the spirit self.

For  someone  who  can  “see”  in  spiritual  regions,  this
spiritual constitution is a perceptible reality—the higher,
truly  spiritual  portion  of  the  aura.  A  seer  can  “see”  the
spirit body as life spirit inside the spiritual skin, can see
how  the  life  spirit  constantly  grows  larger  by  taking  in
nourishment from the outer spiritual world, and can also
see how, as a result, the spiritual skin continues to expand
and the spirit body becomes larger and larger. Of course
the spatial concept of “getting larger” is only an image of
the actual reality. Nevertheless, in picturing this, we are

[39]

[40]


directed toward the corresponding spiritual reality. The
difference between the human being as a spiritual being
and as a physical being is that physical growth is restrict-
ed to a fixed size while spiritual growth can continue in-
definitely. What is taken in as spiritual nourishment is of
eternal value.

It follows that the human aura is made up of two inter-
penetrating parts, one of which is given form and color by
our  physical  existence,  the  other  by  our  spiritual  exist-
ence. [41] The “I” provides the separation between the
two: The physical relinquishes its distinctive character to
build up a body that allows a soul to come to life, while
on the other side the “I” does the same, allowing the spirit
to have a life within it. The spirit in turn permeates the
soul and gives it a goal in the spiritual world. Through the
physical body, the soul is confined to physical existence;
through the spirit body, it grows wings that give it mobil-
ity in the spiritual world.

If we want to comprehend the human being as a whole,
we must imagine that each individual is put together out
of  the  components  described  above.  The  physical  body
builds itself up out of the world of physical substance in
such a way that this structure meets the requirements of a
thinking “I.” This body is permeated by life force, thus
becoming the ether body or life body. As such, it opens
itself up to the outside in the sense organs, and becomes
the soul body. The soul body is permeated by, and forms


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


a unity with, the sentient soul. The sentient soul not only
receives the impressions of the outer world in the form of
sensations but also has a life of its own that is fructified
both by sensations from one side and by thinking from the
other. Through this it can become the “mind soul.” By be-
ing open to intuitions from above as well just as it is open
to sensations from below, it becomes the consciousness
soul. This is possible because the spiritual world builds
the  organ  of  intuition  into  it,  just  as  the  physical  body
builds the sense organs for it. The senses transmit sensa-
tions to it by means of the soul body; similarly, the spirit
transmits intuitions to it by means of the organ of intu-
ition. Thus the spirit body and the consciousness soul are
linked in an entity analogous to the linking of the physical
body and the sentient soul in the soul body. That is, the
consciousness  soul  and  the  spirit  self  form  a  unity  in
which  the  spirit  body  lives  as  the  life  spirit,  just  as  the
ether body forms the living bodily basis for the soul body.
And  just  as  the  physical  body  is  contained  within  the
physical skin, the spirit body is also contained within the
spiritual skin. As a result, the entire human being is sub-
divided into the following members:

A. Material, physical body
B. Ether body or life body
C. Soul body
D. Sentient soul
E. Mind soul
F. Consciousness soul


G. Spirit self
H. Life spirit
I.  Spirit body

[43]

The soul body (C) and sentient soul (D) are a unity in
earthly human beings, as are the consciousness soul (F)
and the spirit self (G). This yields seven components of
the earthly human being:

1. The material, physical body
2. The ether or life body
3. The sentient soul body
4. The mind soul
5. The spirit-filled consciousness soul
6. The life spirit
7. The spirit body

[44]

Within the human soul, the “I” flashes up, receives the
impact of the spirit and thus becomes the vehicle of the
spirit body. Thus we each take part in three worlds—the
physical, soul and spiritual worlds. We are rooted in the
physical world through the material-physical body, ether
body and soul body; we come to flower in the spiritual
world through the spirit self, life spirit, and spirit body.
But the stem, which roots at one end and flowers at the
other, is the soul itself.

[45]

It is possible to give a simplified version of this subdi-
vision of the human being that is in complete harmony


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


with the original. Although the human “I” lights up in the
consciousness soul, it also permeates the entire being of
the  soul,  whose  members  on  the  whole  are  less  clearly
separated than the components of the bodily organization
and  interpenetrate  one  another  in  a  higher  sense.  If  we
look at the mind soul and the consciousness soul as the
two garments of the “I” that belong together, with the “I”
as their central core, then the human being can be differ-
entiated  into  physical  body,  life  body,  astral  body,  and
“I,” with the term “astral body” designating the union of
the soul body and the sentient soul. This term is common
in older literature and is here freely applied to that aspect
of the human being that lies beyond what is sense-percep-
tible. Although in a certain respect the sentient soul is also
filled with forces by the “I,” it is so intimately connected
with the soul body that using a single term for the union
of the two is justified.

When the “I” in turn imbues itself with the spirit self,
this spirit self manifests in such a way that the astral body
is worked over from within the soul. What is active in the
astral body to begin with are our drives, desires and pas-
sions, to the extent that we perceive them, as well as our
sense perceptions. Sense perceptions come about through
the soul body, a member of our human constitution that
comes  to  us  from  the  outer  world.  Drives,  desires,  pas-
sions and so on originate in the sentient soul to the extent
that it is filled with forces by our inner self before this in-
ner self gives itself over to the spirit self. When the “I”
imbues itself with the spirit self, the soul in turn fills the
astral body with the spirit self’s forces. As a result, drives,


desires and passions are illuminated by what the “I” has
received from the spirit. The “I” has then become master
over the world of drives, desires and so on by virtue of its
participation in the spiritual world. To the extent that this
mastery takes place, the spirit self appears within the as-
tral  body,  which  is  transformed  as  a  result.  The  astral
body  then  appears  as  a  two-part  entity,  one  part  trans-
formed and the other untransformed. For this reason, we
may call the spirit self, in its manifestation in the human
being, the transformed astral body.

A similar process takes place when we receive the life
spirit into the “I.” The life body is transformed by being
imbued with the life spirit. That is, the life spirit manifests
in such a way that the life body becomes something dif-
ferent. Thus we can also say that the life spirit is the trans-
formed life body.

And again, if the “I” then takes the spirit body into it-
self, it receives the strong force, which it then uses to per-
meate  the  physical  body.  Of  course,  the  part  of  the
physical body that is thus transformed is not perceptible
to the physical senses; this part that has been spiritualized
has become the spirit body. The physical body as a phys-
ical thing is then perceptible to the physical senses, but to
the extent to which it has been spiritualized, it must be
perceived by spiritual faculties. To the outer senses, even
the physical part that has been permeated by the spiritual
appears to be purely physical.

Taking all of this as a basis, we can now present the fol-

lowing subdivision of the human being:


The Essential Nature of the Human Being


1. Physical body
2. Life body
3. Astral body
4. The “I” as the soul’s central core
5. Spirit self as transformed astral body
6. Life spirit as transformed life body
7. Spirit body as transformed physical body

A D D E N D U M

It may seem that the subdivisions of the human constitution pre-
sented  in  this  book  are  based  on  purely  arbitrary  distinctions
between  parts  within  a  monolithic  soul  life.  To  counter  this
objection, it must be emphasized that the signiﬁcance of this phe-
nomenon is similar to that of the appearance of the seven colors
of the rainbow when light passes through a prism. What a physi-
cist  contributes  to  our  understanding  of  light  by  studying  this
process and the seven colors that result is analogous to what the
spiritual  scientist  does  for  our  understanding  of  the  makeup  of
the human soul. The soul’s seven members are not abstract intel-
lectual distinctions any more than are the light’s seven colors. In
both cases, the distinctions rest on the inner nature of the things
themselves, the only difference being that the seven constituents
of light become visible by means of an external device while the
seven components of the soul become perceptible to a method of
spiritual  observation  consistent  with  the  nature  of  the  human
soul.  The  true  nature  of  the  soul  cannot  be  grasped  without
knowing about this subdivision, because the soul belongs to the
transitory world by virtue of three of our constitutional compo-
nents—physical body, life body and soul body—and has its roots


in eternity through the other four constituent parts.

When  the  soul  is  seen  as  a  unity,  its  transitory  and  eternal
aspects  are  indistinguishably  bound  up  with  each  other,  but
unless we are aware of the differentiations within it, we cannot
understand its relationship to the world as a whole. Let me use
another comparison. Chemists separate water into hydrogen and
oxygen, two substances that cannot be distinguished when they
are united in the form of water. However, each of these elements
has an identity of its own and can form compounds with other
elements. Similarly, at death our three lower constitutional com-
ponents  unite  with  the  makeup  of  the  perishable  world,  while
our four higher members unite with the eternal. Refusing to con-
sider this differentiation within the soul is like being a chemist
who  refuses  to  learn  about  decomposing  water  into  hydrogen
and oxygen.

## CHAPTER 2

### DESTINY AND THE REINCARNATION OF THE SPIRIT

[1]

The  soul  lives  and  acts  in  the  middle  ground  between
body  and  spirit.  The  impressions  reaching  the  soul
through the body are fleeting, present only as long as the
body’s organs are open to the things of the outside world.
My eyes perceive the color of a rose only as long as they
are open and face to face with the rose. The presence of
both the outer-world object and the bodily organ is neces-
sary in order for an impression, a sensation or a percep-
tion to come about.

However, what I recognize in my spirit as true about
the  rose  does  not  pass  away  with  the  present  moment.
This truth is not at all dependent on me—it would be true
even  if  I  had  never  experienced  that  rose.  Whatever  I
may recognize through the spirit is grounded in an ele-
ment of the soul’s life that connects the soul to a univer-
sal content, a content that reveals itself within the soul
but is independent of its transitory bodily basis. Whether
this  content  is  imperishable  in  every  respect  does  not


matter; what matters is that it be revealed in such a way
that  the  soul’s  independent  imperishable  aspect,  rather
than its perishable bodily basis, is involved. The soul’s
enduring aspect comes into view as soon as we become
aware of experiences that are not limited by its transitory
aspect.  Here,  too,  the  important  point  is  not  whether
these  experiences  first  come  to  consciousness  through
transitory  bodily  processes,  but  whether  they  contain
something  that,  although  it  lives  in  the  soul,  still  pos-
sesses  a  truth  independent  of  any  transitory  perceptual
processes.

The soul stands between the present and the permanent
in that it occupies the middle ground between body and
spirit. However, it also mediates between the present and
the permanent. It preserves the present for remembrance,
wresting it away from perishability and giving it a place
in  the  permanence  of  its  own  spiritual  nature.  The  soul
also puts the stamp of permanence on the temporal and
temporary, since it does not simply give itself up to fleet-
ing stimuli but also determines things out of its own ini-
tiative, incorporating its own essence into the actions it
carries out. Through memory, the soul preserves yester-
day; through action, it prepares tomorrow.

If my soul were not able to hold the red color of the rose
through memory, it would have to perceive this red over
and  over  again  to  be  conscious  of  it.  But  whatever  re-
mains after the external impression is gone, whatever my
soul can retain, can once again become a mental image or
representation,  independent  of  the  external  impression.
Through this ability, my soul turns the outer world into its

[2]


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


own  inner  world  by  retaining  the  outer  world  through
memory and continuing to lead an inner life with it, inde-
pendent of any impressions acquired in the past. Thus the
life of the soul becomes a lasting consequence of the tran-
sitory impressions made by the outer world.

But  actions,  too,  acquire  permanence  once  they  have
been  stamped  on  the  outer  world.  When  I  cut  a  branch
from a tree, something that happens because of my soul
totally  changes  the  course  of  events  in  the  outer  world.
Something  quite  different  would  have  happened  to  that
branch had I not intervened with my action. I have called
up  a  series  of  consequences  that  would  not  have  been
present without me, and what I have done today will re-
main in effect tomorrow. It has become lasting through
my action, just as yesterday’s impressions have become
lasting for my soul through memory.

In our ordinary consciousness, we do not usually form
a  concept  of  “becoming  lasting  through  action”  in  the
same way that we form a concept of memory, of becom-
ing lasting as a result of observation or perception. But is
the “I” not just as strongly linked to a change in the world
that results from its own action as it is to a memory that
results from an impression? The “I” assesses new impres-
sions differently, according to the memories it has or does
not have, of one thing or of another. As an “I,” however,
it also enters into another relationship with the world that
depends on whether it has carried out a certain action or
another. Whether or not I made an impression on some-
one else through something I have done depends on the
presence or absence of something in the relationship of

[3]

[4]


the world to my “I.” I am a different person in my rela-
tionship to the world once I have made an impression on
my environment. We do not notice this as easily as we no-
tice how the “I” changes through acquiring a memory, but
this  is  only  because  as  soon  as  a  memory  is  formed  it
unites with the overall life of the soul we have always re-
garded as our own, while the external consequence of an
action,  released  from  this  soul  life,  goes  on  working
through aftereffects that are quite different from what we
can remember about the action. In spite of this, we must
admit that something is now in the world as a result of our
completed  action,  something  whose  character  has  been
stamped on it by the “I.”

Thinking this through carefully, we arrive at a ques-
tion:  Could  it  be  that  the  results  of  our  actions,  whose
character has been impressed on them by the “I,” have a
tendency to come back to the “I” in the same way that an
impression  preserved  in  memory  comes  to  life  again
when an outer circumstance evokes it? What is preserved
in memory is waiting for a reason to reappear. Could it
be the same with things in the outer world that have been
made lasting by the character of the “I”? Are they wait-
ing to approach the soul from outside, just as a memory
waits for a reason to approach from inside? This is only
posed here as a question, since these results, laden with
the character of our “I,” may well never have any reason
or  opportunity  to  meet  our  soul  again.  However,  if  we
follow this line of thought carefully, we can immediately
see that such results could exist, and by their very exist-
ence determine the relationship of the world to the “I.”


[5]

Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


The next thing to investigate is whether anything in hu-
man life suggests that this conceptual possibility points
to an actual reality.

Looking  first  at  memory,  we  can  ask  how  it  comes
about. Obviously the process is quite different from how
sensation  or  perception  comes  about.  Without  eyes,  I
could not have the sensation of blue. However, my eyes
do not give me any memory of the blue; for them to pro-
vide the sensation, something blue must be in view at this
moment. My bodily nature would allow all impressions to
sink back down into oblivion if something were not also
taking place in the relationship between the outer world
and my soul—namely the formation of a current mental
image through the act of perception, with the result that,
through inner processes, I may later again have a mental
image of something that originally brought about a men-
tal image from outside. People who have become prac-
ticed at observing the soul will realize that it is all wrong
to say that if I have a mental image today, the same mental
image shows up again tomorrow in my memory, having
stayed  somewhere  inside  me  in  the  meantime.  On  the
contrary, the mental image that I have right now is a phe-
nomenon that passes away with the present moment. But
if memory intervenes, a process takes place in me that is
the result of something additional that has gone on in the
relationship between me and the outer world, something
other than the evoking of the current mental image. The


old  mental  image  has  not  been  “stored”  anywhere;  the
one  my  memory  calls  up  is  a  new  one.  Remembering
means being able to visualize something anew; it does not
mean that a mental image can come to life again. What
appears  today  is  something  different  from  the  original
mental  image.  This  point  is  being  made  because  in  the
field of spiritual science it is necessary to form more pre-
cise concepts about certain things than we do in ordinary
life, or even in ordinary science. Remembering means ex-
periencing  something  that  is  no  longer  there,  linking  a
past experience to my present life. This happens in every
instance of remembering. Suppose I meet someone I rec-
ognize because I met him or her yesterday. This person
would be a total stranger to me if I could not link the im-
age  formed  through  yesterday’s  perception  to  my  im-
pression of today. Today’s image is given to me by per-
ception, that is, by my sensory system. But who conjures
up yesterday’s image into my soul? It is the same being in
me who was present at both yesterday’s encounter and to-
day’s.  Throughout  the  preceding  discussion,  this  being
has been called “the soul.” Without this trusty keeper of
the past, every external impression would be a new one
for  us.  The  soul  imprints  on  the  body  the  process  by
which something becomes a memory. However, the soul
must first do the imprinting, and then perceive its imprint
just as it perceives something outside itself. In this way,
the soul is the keeper of memory.

As the keeper of the past, the soul is continually collect-
ing treasures for the spirit. My ability to distinguish right
from wrong is due to the fact that as a human being, I am

[6]


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


a  thinking  being  capable  of  grasping  truth  in  my  spirit.
The truth is eternal; even if I were continually losing sight
of the past and each impression were new to me, the truth
could still always reveal itself to me again in things. But
the spirit in me is not restricted to the impressions of the
moment; my soul widens the spirit’s field of vision to in-
clude the past. And the more my soul can add to the spirit
from  the  past,  the  richer  the  spirit  becomes.  The  soul
passes on to the spirit what it has received from the body.
Thus, at every moment of its life, the human spirit carries
two very different elements—first, the eternal laws of the
true and the good; second, the recollection of past experi-
ences. Whatever it does is accomplished under the influ-
ence  of  these  two  factors.  Therefore,  if  we  want  to
understand a human spirit, we must know two different
things about it—first, how much of the eternal has been
revealed to it, and second, how many treasures from the
past it holds.

These treasures do not remain in an unchanged form for
the spirit, however. The impressions we gain from experi-
ence gradually fade from memory, but their fruits do not.
For example, we do not remember all the experiences we
went through as children learning to read and write, but we
would not be able to read or write now if we had not had
these experiences and if their fruits had not been preserved
in the form of abilities. This is how the spirit transforms its
treasure trove of memories. It abandons to fate anything
that  can  lead  only  to  images  of  individual  experiences,
keeping only the power to heighten its own abilities. We
can  be  sure  that  not  a  single  experience  goes  to  waste,

[7]


[8]


since the soul preserves each one as a memory, and the
spirit  extracts  from  each  one  whatever  it  can  use  to  en-
hance  its  abilities  and  enrich  its  life.  The  human  spirit
grows as these experiences are worked over and assimi-
lated. Thus, although we do not find our past experiences
preserved in the spirit as if in a treasure vault, we do find
their effects in the abilities we have acquired.

•

 •

Until now, we have been considering the spirit and the
soul only between birth and death, but we cannot leave it
at that. That would be like considering the human body
only within these same confines. Of course much can be
discovered within them, but we will never be able to ex-
plain the human form through what exists between birth
and death. This Gestalt cannot build itself up directly out
of mere physical substances and forces; it must descend
from another form or Gestalt, like itself, that has come
about  through  reproduction.  Physical  substances  and
forces  build  up  the  body  during  its  lifetime,  while  the
forces  of  reproduction  enable  it  to  bring  forth  another
body of the same form—that is, one that can be the carrier
of the same life body. Every life body is a repetition of its
immediate ancestor, and because this is so, the form the
life body assumes is never arbitrary, but is the one that it
has inherited. The forces that have made my human form
possible came from my ancestors.

But  the  human  spirit  also  assumes  a  definite  form  or
Gestalt (the words  are of  course  being  used  here  in  a


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


spiritual sense). And human spiritual forms are as differ-
ent as they can possibly be; no two individuals have the
same spiritual form. Our observation in this realm must
be as calm and objective as it is on the physical plane. We
cannot maintain that the spiritual differences in people re-
sult only from differences in their environment, their up-
bringing  and  so  on.  That  is  not  true  at  all,  because  two
people from similar environments and of similar educa-
tional  backgrounds  can  still  develop  in  very  different
ways. We are forced to admit that they must have begun
life with very different endowments.

At this point we are confronted with an important state
of  affairs  which,  if  we  recognize  its  full  implications,
sheds light on the essential nature and constitution of the
human being. Of course if we choose to turn our attention
only to the material aspect of events, we could say that
the  individual  differences  in  human  personalities  result
from  genetic  differences  in  the  reproductive  cells  they
develop from. If we take into account the laws of heredity
discovered by Gregor Mendel and developed further by
others, this point of view can indeed seem very plausible
and also scientifically justifiable. Such a point of view,
however, only demonstrates a lack of insight into how we
really relate to our  experience.  Careful  observation  of
the pertinent details will show that outer circumstances
affect different people in different ways through some-
thing that never directly interacts with their material de-
velopment. A precise researcher in this field will see that
what  proceeds  from  material  potentials  is  separate  and
distinct from what may originate in our interaction with


[9]

[10]


our experiences but takes shape only because the soul it-
self enters into the interaction. Clearly, the soul relates to
something  in  the  outer  world  that,  through  its  very  na-
ture, has no connection to genetic potentials.

In our physical form or Gestalt, we are different from
the animals, our fellow creatures on the earth. Within cer-
tain  limits,  however,  all  human  beings  are  of  similar
form; there is only one human genus and species. No mat-
ter how great the differences between races, tribes, peo-
ples and personalities may be, in all physical respects the
similarity  between  two  human  beings  is  always  greater
than that between a human being and an animal of any
species. Everything that comes to expression in the hu-
man species is determined by heredity, passed down from
one generation to the next. Our human form is bound to
this heredity. Just as a lion can inherit its physical form
only from its lion ancestors, we can inherit ours only from
our human ancestors.

The physical similarity between human beings is appar-
ent to the eye, and the difference between human spiritual
forms is equally apparent to the unbiased spiritual view.
This is demonstrated by one very evident fact—that hu-
man  beings  have  biographies.  If  we  were  nothing  more
than  members  of  our  species,  no  individual  biographies
would be possible. A lion or a pigeon is of interest only as
a member of the lion or pigeon species; we understand ev-
erything essential about the individual once we have de-
scribed the species. It does not really matter whether we
are dealing with a parent, child or grandchild—what is in-
teresting about them is common to all three generations.


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


What a human individual signifies, however, only begins
where he or she stops being merely a member of a genus
and species and becomes an individual being. I certainly
cannot grasp the essential nature of Mr. John Doe by de-
scribing his son or his father—I have to know his own per-
sonal biography. If we think about the nature of biography,
we will realize that with regard to the spirit, each human
being is his or her individual genus.

Of course, if “biography” is interpreted to mean noth-
ing more than a superficial listing of events and experi-
ences, we might well insist that it would be possible to
write the biography of a dog in the same sense as that of
a person. However, if a biographer captures a human be-
ing’s  uniqueness,  it  will  be  clear  that  this  biography  of
one human being corresponds to the description of an en-
tire  animal  species.  Obviously  something  resembling  a
biography can be written about an animal, especially an
intelligent one, but that is not the point. The point is that
a human biography corresponds to the description of an
animal species rather than to the biography of an individ-
ual animal. Some people will always try to refute state-
ments  like  this  by  saying  that  people  who  work  with
animals—zookeepers, for instance—are well aware of in-
dividual differences between animals of the same species.
Such comments, however, demonstrate only an inability
to distinguish individual differences from differences that
can be acquired only through individuality.

Just as genus and species can be understood in a physi-
cal sense only once we grasp that they are determined by
heredity, the individual spiritual being can be understood

[11]

only by means of a similar spiritual heredity. I possess
my physical human form because I am descended from
human ancestors. But where does what is expressed in my
biography come from? As a physical human being, I re-
peat the form of my ancestors, but what do I repeat as a
spiritual human being? If we insist that what my biogra-
phy encompasses must simply be accepted as it is, that it
needs no further explanation, we might as well also claim
to have seen a hill out there where lumps of matter stuck
themselves together into a living human being.

As a physical human being, I am descended from other
physical human beings; I have the same form or Gestalt
as the rest of the human genus. This shows that the char-
acteristics of a genus are acquired within it through hered-
ity.  But  as  a  spiritual  human  being,  I  have  my  own
particular  form,  just  as  I  have  a  personal  biography.
Therefore, I cannot have acquired this form from anyone
other than myself. And since I came into this world, not
with  general,  but  with  very  specific  predispositions  of
soul  that  have  determined  the  course  of  my  life  as  re-
vealed by my biography, my work on myself cannot have
begun at birth. I must have been present as a spiritual in-
dividual before my birth. I was certainly not present in my
ancestors, because as spiritual individuals they are differ-
ent from me, and their biographies cannot explain mine.
Instead, I must—as a spiritual being—be the repetition of
one whose biography can explain mine.

The only other conceivable possibility would be that I
have only a spiritual life before birth (or conception) to
thank for molding what my biography encompasses. This


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


idea would be justifiable, however, only if we were to as-
sume that what works on a human soul from its physical
surroundings is of the same character as what the soul re-
ceives  from  a  purely  spiritual  world.  This  assumption
contradicts precise observation, however: What exerts a
determining influence on a human soul from its physical
surroundings works on it in the same way that a new ex-
perience  works  on  a  similar  earlier  experience  in  our
physical life. To observe these relationships correctly, we
must  learn  to  perceive  that  some  impressions  in  human
life  work  on  the  soul’s  potentials  in  the  same  way  that
standing before something still to be done works on what
we  have  already  practiced  repeatedly  in  physical  life.
Rather than affecting abilities acquired through practice
in the course of this life, these impressions affect poten-
tial abilities of the soul. If we achieve insight into these
things, we arrive at the idea of earthly lives that must have
preceded this one. In thinking about it, we can no longer
be content with assuming that this life is preceded only by
purely spiritual experiences.

Schiller carried a physical form that he inherited from
his ancestors; this physical form could not possibly have
grown up out of the earth. The same is true of Schiller as
a spiritual individuality; he must have been the repetition
of another spiritual being whose biography accounts for
his, just as human reproduction accounts for his physical
form. The human physical form is a repetition or reem-
bodiment, over and over again, of what is inherent in the
human genus and species. Similarly, a spiritual individual
must be a reembodiment or reincarnation of one and the


[13]

[14]


same spiritual being, for as a spiritual being, each person
is his or her own species.

We can object that what has been said here is a mere ar-
rangement  of  thoughts,  and  we  can  demand  external
proof of it as we are accustomed to do in the case of ordi-
nary science. However, it must be pointed out that the re-
incarnation of the spiritual human being is a process that
does not belong to the domain of outer physical facts but
takes place exclusively in the spiritual domain, and that of
all our ordinary mental powers, only thinking has access
to this realm. If we refuse to trust the power of thinking,
we will never be able to explain higher spiritual facts to
ourselves. But for anyone whose spiritual eye is open, the
above train of thought is just as compelling as any process
taking place in front of our physical eyes. Those who find
a  so-called  “proof”  constructed  along  the  lines  of  ordi-
nary scientific knowledge more persuasive than what has
been presented about the significance of biography may
well be great scientists in the usual sense of the word, but
they are far removed from the methods of true spiritual
research.

The attempt to explain a person’s spiritual attributes as
an inheritance from parents or other ancestors is evidence
of a very dubious prejudice indeed. Those who are guilty
of assuming that Goethe, for instance, inherited anything
essential  to  his  nature  from  his  father  and  mother  will
probably not respond to reason, since they harbor a deep
antipathy toward unbiased observation. Their materialis-
tic  persuasion  prevents  them  from  seeing  relationships
between phenomena in the right light.


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


What has been presented so far provides the prerequi-
sites  for  tracing  our  essential  being  beyond  birth  and
death. Within the confines of birth and death, the human
being belongs to the three worlds of bodily nature, soul
nature and spirit nature. The soul forms the link between
body and spirit by permeating the body’s third member,
the soul body, with the capacity for sensation and—as the
consciousness  soul—by  pervading  the  first  spiritual
member,  the  spirit  self.  Throughout  life,  therefore,  the
soul participates in both body and spirit, and this partici-
pation is expressed in all aspects of its existence. The or-
ganization of the soul body determines to what extent the
sentient soul can unfold its capacities; on the other hand,
the consciousness soul’s own life determines the extent to
which the spirit self can develop within it. The better the
soul body’s development, the better the sentient soul can
develop its interaction with the outer world; the more the
consciousness soul supplies the spirit self with nourish-
ment,  the  richer  and  more  powerful  the  spirit  self  be-
comes.  During  life,  the  spirit  self  is  supplied  with  this
nourishment through worked-over and assimilated expe-
riences,  and  through  their  fruits,  as  has  been  demon-
strated. Naturally, this interaction between soul and spirit
can take place only where the two intermingle, that is, in
the joining of the spirit self and the consciousness soul.

Let  us  look  first  at  the  interaction  between  the  soul
body and the sentient soul. Although, as we have seen,
the soul body is the most finely fashioned aspect of our
bodily nature, it still belongs to and is dependent on this
bodily nature. In one respect, the physical body, the ether

[15]

[16]


body  and  the  soul  body  form  a  totality.  Therefore,  the
soul body is also subject to the laws of physical heredity
through which the body receives its form, but since it is
the most ephemeral aspect of our physical nature, it must
also show the most ephemeral manifestations of hered-
ity. Human physical bodies differ only slightly on the ba-
sis  of  race,  nation  and  family,  and  although  individual
ether bodies vary more, they still show a great similarity.
However, when it comes to the soul body, the differences
are  already  very  great.  In  the  soul  body,  what  we  per-
ceive as a person’s external personal uniqueness is ex-
pressed;  the  soul  body  is  therefore  also  the  carrier  of
whatever personal uniqueness is passed down from an-
cestors to descendants.

It is true that the soul, as has been described, leads a full
and independent life of its own—it shuts itself off with its
likes and dislikes, emotions and passions. It is active as a
totality,  however,  and  the  sentient  soul,  too,  bears  the
stamp of this totality. Thus, because the sentient soul per-
meates and, so to speak, fills the soul body, the soul body
takes shape in accordance with the nature of the soul and
is then able, through heredity, to transmit the predeces-
sor’s inclinations, passions and so on to the descendants.
Goethe’s saying, “From my father, I get my build and the
tendency  to  take  life  seriously;  from  my  mother,  my
happy disposition and delight in storytelling,”1 is based
on this fact. But his genius, of course, did not come from

1. “Vom  Vater  hab  ich  die  Statur,  des  Lebens  ernstes  Führen;  vom
Mütterchen die Frohnatur, die Lust zu fabulieren.”


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


either of his parents. This gives us an idea of what kinds
of soul qualities are, in effect, turned over to the line of
physical heredity.

The  substances  and  forces  of  the  physical  body  are
present in the very same way all around us in outer phys-
ical nature—we are continually taking them in from out-
side and giving them back again. Over the course of a few
years, all the substances that make up the physical body
are renewed. They are continually being renewed, yet al-
ways take on the form of a human body because the ether
body holds them together. And the ether body’s form is
not determined solely by processes taking place between
birth (or conception) and death, but is also dependent on
the laws of heredity that extend beyond birth and death.
Because the soul body can be influenced by the sentient
soul, characteristic soul qualities can also be transmitted
through the line of heredity—that is, the soul has an im-
pact on the process of physical heredity.

And what about the interaction between soul and spirit?
During life, the spirit is bound to the soul in the way de-
scribed earlier. From the spirit, the soul receives the gift
of living in the true and the good, and this enables it to
bring the spirit itself to expression in its own life, in its in-
clinations, drives and passions. The spirit self brings the
eternal laws of the true and the good to the “I” from the
world of the spirit. By means of our consciousness soul,
these laws are linked to the soul’s own individual life ex-
periences.  These  experiences  are  transitory,  but  their
fruits are lasting; the fact that they have been linked to the
spirit self makes a lasting impression on it. If the human

[17]


spirit  then  approaches  such  an  experience  and  finds  it
similar to another that it has already been linked to in the
past, it recognizes something familiar in it and knows that
it must behave differently toward this than if it were en-
countering  it  for  the  first  time.  This  is  the  basis  of  all
learning.  The  fruits  of  learning  are  the  abilities  we  ac-
quire, and in this way, the fruits of our transitory life are
imprinted on our immortal spirit.

Are we aware of these fruits in some way? Where do
those potentials described above as characteristic of the
spiritual human being come from? Surely they can only
be  based  on  the  various  capabilities  people  bring  with
them when they set out on their earthly journey. In some
respects, these capabilities are quite like the ones we can
acquire during our lifetime. Take the case of a genius, for
instance. As a boy Mozart could write down from mem-
ory a long piece of music he had heard only once. He was
able  to  do  so  only  because  he  could  survey  the  whole
thing all at once, as a totality. In the course of our lifetime,
we  can  all—at  least  within  certain  limits—broaden  our
capacity to gain an overview of things and to understand
the  relationships  between  them.  We  then  possess  new
abilities. Lessing, for example, said that through his gift
for critical observation, he had acquired something very
close to genius. If we are not inclined to see such abilities,
rooted in inborn potential, as miracles, we must see them
as  the  fruits  of  what  the  spirit  self  has  experienced
through a soul. They have been impressed upon the spirit
self, and since it did not happen in this lifetime, it must
have happened in a previous one.


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


Each human spirit is a species in it own right. Just as in-
dividual  human  beings  pass  on  their  characteristics  the
spirit passes on its characteristics within its species—that
is, within itself. In each life the human spirit appears as a
repetition of itself, with the fruits of its experiences in ear-
lier lifetimes. Thus this lifetime is the repetition of others,
and brings with it what the spirit self has gained in its pre-
vious life. When the spirit self takes in something that can
develop into fruit, it imbues itself with the life spirit. Just
as  the  life  body  reproduces  the  form  of  a  species  from
generation  to  generation,  the  life  spirit  reproduces  the
soul from one personal existence to the next.

The discussion up to this point has shown the validity
of the idea that certain processes in human life can be ex-
plained in terms of repeated earth lives. The full signifi-
cance of this idea can be realized only through the kind of
observation  that  stems  from  spiritual  insights  such  as
those  acquired  by  following  the  path  to  knowledge  de-
scribed at the end of this book. It should be pointed out
that  ordinary  observation,  properly  guided  by  thinking,
can  lead  us  to  this  idea,  although  to  begin  with  it  will
leave the idea in a shadow-like stage and will not be able
to defend it completely against objections that arise from
imprecise  observation  not  properly  guided  by  thinking.
On the other hand, anyone who comes to this idea through
ordinary  thoughtful  observation  is  preparing  for  super-
sensible observation by beginning to develop something
we must have before supersensible observation can begin,
just as we must have eyes before physical observation is
possible.  And  people  who  object  that  by  conceiving  an

[18]


[19]


idea like this we could talk ourselves into believing in the
reality  of  supersensible  perception,  only  prove  them-
selves incapable of really taking up the truth through in-
dependent  thinking;  they  are  talking  themselves  into
believing their own objections.

In this way the soul’s experiences become lasting, not
only within the confines of birth and death but also be-
yond death. But the soul imprints these experiences not
only  on  the  spirit  lighting  up  within  it,  but  also—by
means  of  its  actions—on  the  outer  world,  as  has  been
pointed out. What someone did yesterday is still present
today in the form of its effects.

Along  these  lines,  the  metaphor  of  sleep  and  death
gives us a picture of the connection between cause and
effect. Sleep has often been called “the younger brother
of death.” I get up in the morning. The continuity of my
activity has been interrupted by the night. Under normal
circumstances, I cannot resume my activity arbitrarily—
I must link up with what I did yesterday if my life is to
have any order and cohesiveness. Yesterday’s actions are
now the conditions I must abide by in what I do today;
through what I did yesterday, I have created my destiny
for today. I have disengaged myself from my own activ-
ity for a while, but it belongs to me and pulls me back
again after I have withdrawn from it for a while. My past
continues to be connected to me; it lives on in my present
and will follow me into my future. Instead of waking up


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


this  morning,  I  would  have  to  be  created  anew,  out  of
nothing, if the effects of my actions from yesterday were
not meant to be my destiny today. It would be as absurd
as if under ordinary circumstances I had had a house built
for myself and then did not move into it.

But we are not created anew each morning, nor is the
human spirit created anew as it starts the journey of its
earthly life. We must try to understand what really does
happen when we set out on this journey. A physical body
makes its appearance, having received its form through
the laws of heredity. This body becomes the vehicle for a
spirit that is repeating an earlier life in a new form. Be-
tween  the  two,  leading  a  self-contained  life  of  its  own,
stands the soul. It is served by its likes and dislikes, and
its wishes and desires, and places thinking in its service.
As  the  sentient  soul,  it  receives  impressions  from  the
outer world and carries them to the spirit, which extracts
and  preserves  their  fruits.  The  soul  plays  a  mediator’s
role, in a sense, and its task is accomplished in playing
this  role  satisfactorily.  The  body  forms  impressions  for
the soul, which reshapes them into sensations, stores them
in the memory as mental images, and passes them on to
the  spirit  to  be  made  lasting.  The  soul  is  what  actually
makes us belong to this earthly life. Through the body, we
belong to the physical human genus; we are members of
this genus. With our spirit, we live in a higher world. The
soul binds the two worlds together for a while.

On entering the physical world, the human spirit finds
itself, not in an unfamiliar setting, but in one that bears
the imprint of its actions. Something in this new setting

[20]

[21]


belongs to the spirit, bears the stamp of its being, is re-
lated to it. Just as the soul once conveyed impressions of
the outer world to the spirit to be made lasting, it also, as
the  spirit’s  organ,  transformed  its  spirit-given  faculties
into actions that, in their effects, are equally lasting. In
doing so, the soul actually flowed into these actions. In
the effects of its actions, the human soul lives on in a sec-
ond independent life. This gives us grounds for examin-
ing  how  the  processes  of  destiny  enter  into  life.
Something  happens  to  us,  “bumps  into  us,”  enters  our
life as if by chance—or so we tend to think at first. We
can become aware, however, that each one of us is the re-
sult of many such “chance” occurrences. If at the age of
forty I take a good look at myself and refuse to be content
with an empty, abstract concept of the “I” as I ponder my
soul’s  essential  nature,  I  may  well  conclude  that  I  am
nothing more and nothing less than what I have become
through what has happened to me until now as a matter
of destiny. I would probably have been a different person
if, at age twenty, I had had a different series of experi-
ences than what actually did happen to me. I will then
look for my “I” not only in its developmental influences
that come from within, but also in what exerts a forma-
tive influence on my life from outside. I will recognize
my own “I” in what “happens to” me.

If we give ourselves impartially to such a realization, we
need to take only one more step in intimately observing
life before we can see, in what comes to us through certain
experiences  of  destiny,  something  that  takes  hold  of  the
“I” from outside, just as memory works from inside to


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


allow past experiences to light up again. In this way, we
can become able to recognize an experience of destiny as
a past action of the soul finding its way to the “I,” just as a
memory is a past experience that is reinvoked by outer cir-
cumstances and finds its way into our minds as a mental
image.

The idea that the results of its own actions may meet the
soul again has already been discussed as a possibility (See
pp. 96ff). However, a meeting of this sort cannot come
about within the confines of a single life on earth because
this life has been organized and prepared in such a way as
to bring about the action in question. The experience is in-
tertwined with the accomplishment of the action. It is as
impossible for a specific consequence of this action to re-
turn to the soul as it is for us to remember an experience
when we are still in the middle of it. Rather, what comes
into question here is our experience of consequences that
meet  the  “I”  when  it  does  not  have  the  aptitudes  it  had
during the lifetime in which the action was performed—
that is, it is only possible to focus on consequences that
come from other earthly lives. As soon as we sense that
some apparently coincidental experience is as closely re-
lated to the “I” as anything that takes shape out of the in-
ner being of the “I,” we can only conclude that in such an
experience  of  destiny  we  are  confronting  consequences
that come from earlier lives on earth. As we can see, an
intimate,  thought-guided  approach  to  life  leads  us  to
adopt the idea (paradoxical as it may seem to our ordinary
consciousness) that what we experience as destiny in one
lifetime is related to our actions in previous earthly lives.


[22]


Once again, the full import of this idea can be realized
only through supersensible knowledge, without which it
remains  shadow-like  at  best.  But  here  too,  the  idea  ac-
quired by means of ordinary consciousness prepares our
soul for witnessing its full truth through genuine super-
sensible perception.

However,  only  one  part  of  my  action  is  out  in  the
world; the other part is in me. We can take a simple par-
allel from the field of biology to clarify the relationship
between an “I” and its actions. In certain caves in Ken-
tucky are animals that were able to see when they first
ventured in, but have lost their sight through prolonged
living in darkness. Their eyes have stopped functioning;
the  physical  and  chemical  activity  taking  place  during
seeing no longer happens in them, and the stream of nu-
trients  that  once  supported  this  activity  has  been  redi-
rected to other organs. By now, these animals can live
only in caves. Through their original action, migrating
into the caves, they have determined the conditions un-
der which they must now live. Their migration has be-
come  a  part  of  their  destiny  or  fate.  A  being  that  was
active in the past has linked itself to the results of its own
actions. It is the same with the human spirit. Only by be-
ing active could the soul transmit certain capabilities to
the spirit; these  capabilities  correspond  directly  to  ac-
tions. An action that the soul has carried out gives it the
strength and potential to carry out another action which
is the direct fruit of the first. The soul carries this around
as  an  inner  necessity  until  the  second  action  has  been
completed. We could also say that through an action, the


[23]

Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


need  to  carry  out  its  consequence  is  impressed  on  the
soul.

Through  its  actions,  each  human  spirit  has  truly  pre-
pared its own destiny. It finds itself linked in each new
lifetime to what it did in the previous one. We may won-
der  how  that  could  possibly  be,  since  the  reincarnating
spirit finds itself in a world totally different from the one
it left behind. The way we conceive of the chain of des-
tiny  when  we  ask  such  a  question,  however,  clings  to
quite external and superficial aspects of life. If my field of
activity is shifted from Europe to America, I will also find
myself  in  totally  new  surroundings,  and  yet  my  life  in
America will still be quite dependent on how I used to live
in  Europe.  If  I  was  a  mechanic  in  Europe,  my  life  in
America will take shape quite differently than it would if
I was a banker. In the first instance, I will probably be sur-
rounded by machinery again in America; in the second,
by the trappings of the banking business. In each case, my
former life determines my surroundings; it extracts from
the entire surrounding world those things that are related
to it, so to speak. It is the same with the spirit self. In a
new life, it is obliged to surround itself with things it is re-
lated to from its previous life.

That is why sleep is a helpful image for death, because
during  sleep  we  are  also  withdrawn  from  the  arena  in
which our destiny awaits for us. While we are sleeping,
events in this arena continue without us, and for a while
we have no influence on the course they take. Neverthe-
less, how we live the next day still depends on the effects
of what we did the day before. In reality, our personalities


are reembodied anew each morning in the world of our
actions. It is as if what we were separated from during the
night is spread out around us during the day. The same
holds true for the actions we carried out in earlier incar-
nations.  They  are  bound  to  us  as  our  destiny,  just  as
dwelling in dark caves is bound to the animals who lost
their sense of sight through migrating into those caves.
Just as these animals can live only in the surroundings in
which  they  now  find  themselves,  surroundings  into
which they have inserted themselves, a human spirit can
live  only  in  the  environment  it  has  created  for  itself
through  its  own  actions.  The  ongoing  course  of  events
sees to it that when I wake in the morning, I find myself
in a situation that I myself created the previous day. Sim-
ilarly, my reincarnating spirit’s relationship to the objects
in the surroundings sees to it that I enter an environment
corresponding to my actions in the previous life.

From the above, we can form an idea of how the soul is
incorporated into the overall organization of a human be-
ing. The physical body is subject to the laws of heredity.
The  human  spirit,  on  the  other  hand,  must  reincarnate
over  and  over  again,  and  its  law  consists  in  having  to
carry the fruits of previous lifetimes over into the follow-
ing ones. Our souls live in the present, although this life
in  the  present  is  not  independent  of  our  previous  lives,
since each incarnating spirit brings its destiny along with
it from previous incarnations, and this destiny determines
its present life. What impressions our souls will be capa-
ble  of  receiving,  which  of  our  desires  can  be  fulfilled,
what joys and sorrows will be our lot, what other human


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


beings we will meet—all this depends on what our actions
were  like  in  earlier  incarnations  of  the  spirit.  People  to
whom our souls were connected in one lifetime will nec-
essarily encounter us again in a later one, because the ac-
tions  that  took  place  between  us  must  have  their
consequences. Souls that have once been associated will
venture into reincarnation at the same time. Thus, the life
of the soul is a product of the spirit’s self-created destiny.
The course of a human life within the framework of life
and death is determined in three different ways, and we are
also therefore dependent on three factors that go beyond
birth and death. The body is subject to the laws of heredity;
the soul is subject to self-created destiny or, to use an an-
cient term, to its karma; and the spirit is subject to the laws
of reincarnation  or  repeated  earthly  lives.  The  interrela-
tionship of body, soul and spirit can also be expressed as
follows: The spirit is immortal; birth and death govern our
bodily existence in accordance with the laws of the physi-
cal world; and the life of the soul, which is subject to des-
tiny, mediates between body and spirit during the course of
an earthly life. These three worlds to which we belong will
be the subject of the next section of this book, since some
familiarity with them is a prerequisite for all further knowl-
edge of the essential nature of the human being.

If our way of thinking comes to grips with life’s phe-
nomena and does not hesitate to follow thoughts resulting
from living, vital observation through to their final rami-
fications,  we  can  indeed  arrive  at  the  idea  of  repeated
earthly lives and the law of destiny through mere logic. It
is true that for a seer with opened spiritual eyes, past lives

[24]


are present as a direct experience, like reading from an
open book, but it is equally true that the truth of all of this
can  come  to  light  for  anyone  with  an  active,  observant
reasoning ability.

A D D E N D U M

The  statements  in  this  chapter  on  reincarnation  and  karma
attempt  to  convey  the  extent  to  which  human  life  and  destiny
point in and of themselves to the idea of repeated earth lives. The
intent  was  to  do  so  by  thoughtfully  considering  the  course  of
human life without referring to the spiritual scientiﬁc ideas pre-
sented in other chapters. Of course the very idea of reincarnation
and karma will seem rather questionable to anyone who accepts
only ideas that assume the existence of only a single earthly life
as being well founded. However, the intention of this chapter is to
show  that  such  ideas  cannot  lead  to  an  understanding  of  why  a
person’s life takes a particular course. In that case we are forced
to  look  for  different  ideas,  which  may  appear  to  contradict  our
usual ones. The only reason for not looking for them would be a
fundamental refusal on our part to apply the same thoughtful con-
sideration  with  which  we  investigate  physical  processes  to  pro-
cesses  that  can  be  grasped  only  inwardly.  This  refusal  would
mean, for instance, that we belittle the fact that our experience of
a  stroke  of  destiny  bears  a  resemblance  to  what  we  experience
when our memory encounters an event related to something we
actually recollect. But if we try to see how a stroke of destiny is
really experienced, we can distinguish between the real state of
affairs  and  what  can  be  said  about  such  an  experience  from  a
merely  external  point  of  view  that  denies  any  vital  connection
between  this  stroke  of  destiny  and  our  “I.”  From  this  point  of
view,  a  stroke  of  destiny  appears  to  be  either  a  coincidence  or
something  determined  from  outside.  And  since  in  fact  some
strokes  of  destiny  actually  are  making  their  ﬁrst  impact  on  a


Destiny and the Reincarnation of the Spirit


human life, so to speak, and only show their results later on, the
temptation  is  all  the  greater  to  generalize  from  such  instances
without taking any other possibility into account.

We begin to consider other possibilities only once life has edu-
cated our cognitive abilities and brought them into line with what
Goethe’s friend Knebel once wrote in a letter:

On close observation, we will find that most people’s lives
contain a plan that seems laid out for them either in their own
character or in the circumstances that guide them. No matter
how changeable and varied their situations may be, in the end
a  certain  wholeness  or  inner  coherence  is  apparent. . . .  The
hand of a specific fate, no matter how hidden its working, is
still clearly to be seen, whether moved by outer causes or by
inner impulses. Often, in fact, we are moved in its direction
for  quite  conflicting  reasons.  No  matter  how  confused  the
course  of  a  life  may  be,  a  plan  and  a  direction  still  show
through.*

Raising objections to an observation of this sort is easy, espe-
cially  for  people  unwilling  to  consider  the  inner  experiences  it
stems  from.  However,  the  author  of  this  book  believes  that  in
what  he  has  said  about  destiny  and  repeated  earth  lives,  he  has
accurately delineated the boundaries within which it is possible to
form  conceptions  about  the  causes  shaping  human  life.  He  has
pointed  out  that  the  conviction  to  which  these  thoughts  lead  is
only sketchily deﬁned by them, that all they can do is prepare us
in  thought  for  what  must  ultimately  be  discovered  by  means  of
spiritual research. In itself, however, as long as this thought prep-
aration  does  not  exaggerate  its  own  importance  or  attempt  to
prove anything, but only trains our soul, it entails an inner effort
that can make us unbiased and receptive to facts we would simply
take for foolish without it.

## CHAPTER 3

### THE THREE WORLDS


[1]

I. The Soul World

We  have  seen  that  as  human  beings  we  belong  to  three
worlds. The substances and forces that build up our bodies
are taken from the world of inanimate matter. We know
about this world through the perceptions of our outer phys-
ical  senses.  Anyone  who  trusts  these  senses  exclusively
and develops only their kind of perception cannot gain ac-
cess to the other two worlds, the soul and spiritual worlds.
Whether or not we can persuade ourselves of the reality of
any being or thing depends on our having an organ of per-
ception, a sense, for it. Of course misunderstandings can
easily arise when the higher organs of perception are re-
ferred to as spiritual “senses,” as they are here. When we
speak  about  “senses,”  we  automatically  think  of  some-
thing physical. We even call the physical world the “sense
world”  in  contrast  to  the  “spiritual  world.”  In  order  to
avoid  misunderstanding,  it  must  be  emphasized  that  the
term “higher senses” is used here only figuratively and as
a comparison. Just as our physical senses perceive what is


physical, our soul and spiritual senses perceive what is of
a soul and spiritual nature. The term “sense” will be used
here only in its meaning of “organ of perception.”

Without eyes that are sensitive to light, we would have
no knowledge of light or of color, just as we would have
no knowledge of sound without ears that are sensitive to
it.  In  this  connection,  the  German  philosopher  Lotze  is
perfectly justified in saying:

Without a light-sensing eye and a sound-sensing
ear,  the  whole  world  would  be  dark  and  silent.  It
would be as impossible to have light and sound in it
as it is to have a toothache without the pain-sensing
nerve.1

To  see  all  of  this  in  the  right  light,  we  need  only  to
imagine how different the world that we human beings
know must appear to lower forms of animal life that pos-
sess only a sense of touch of a sort, spread out over the
surface  of  their  bodies.  Light,  color  and  sound  cannot
possibly be present for them in the sense that they are for
beings endowed with eyes and ears. The vibrations in the
air set off by firing a gun, for example, may also have
some effect on these animals if they are actually touched
by them, but for these vibrations to register in the soul as
a shot, an ear is necessary, just as an eye is necessary if

certain processes taking place in the very fine matter we
know as ether are to appear as light and color.

We can know something about the nature of a being or
thing only because it has an effect on one of our organs.
This  relationship  between  the  human  being  and  the
world of realities is admirably expressed by Goethe:

In reality, any attempt to express the inner nature
of a thing is fruitless. What we perceive are effects,
and  a  complete  record  of  these  effects  ought  to
encompass  this  inner  nature.  We  labor  in  vain  to
describe  a  person’s  character,  but  when  we  draw
together his actions, his deeds, a picture of his char-
acter will emerge.

Colors  are  the  deeds  of  light,  what  it  does  and
what  it  endures. . . .  Although  it  is  true  that  colors
and  light  are  intimately  related  to  one  another  we
must  consider  both  as  belonging  to  all  narure.
Through them nature in its entirety seeks to manifest
itself, in this case to the sense of sight, to the eye.

Similarly, the whole of nature reveals itself to yet
another sense. . . . [It] speaks to other senses which
lie  even  deeper,  to  known, misunderstood,  and
unknown  senses.  Thus  it  converses  with  itself  and
with  us  through  a  thousand  phemomena, No  one
who  is  observant  will  ever  ﬁnd  nature  dead  or
silent.2 (Italics added)

York: Suhrkamp Publishers, 1988), p.158.


[2]


Goethe’s statement should not be interpreted as deny-
ing the possibility of understanding the essential nature of
things. He does not mean that we perceive only the effects
of  things  while  their  true  nature  remains  concealed  be-
hind  these  effects;  rather,  he  means  that  we  should  not
talk about a “concealed nature” at all. The being is not be-
hind  its  manifestation,  but  comes  into  view  through  its
manifestation. However, this being may be so rich that it
can disclose itself in other forms when appearing to other
senses.  What  is  disclosed  does  belong  to  the  being  in
question, but because of the limitations of our senses, it is
not the whole being. Goethe’s view of this is the same as
the spiritual scientific one presented here.

Within our body, our eyes and ears develop as organs
of perception, as senses for bodily processes. Similarly,
we  can  develop  soul  and  spiritual  organs  of  perception
that will open up soul and spirit worlds to us. For anyone
who does not have such higher senses, these worlds are
dark and silent, just as the physical world is dark and si-
lent to a being without eyes and ears. However, we relate
differently  to  these  higher  senses  than  to  our  physical
ones, which as a rule are fully developed in us by good
Mother Nature without our doing anything about it. But
we ourselves must work at developing our higher senses.
Just as nature develops our physical body so that we can

perceive our physical surroundings and orient ourselves
in them, so we must cultivate our own soul and spirit if we
want to perceive the soul and spirit worlds.

There is nothing unnatural about cultivating the higher
organs that nature itself has not yet developed, because in
a higher sense, everything that human beings accomplish
also belongs to nature. Only those who contend that we
should all stay at the level of development where nature
left us could call developing these higher senses “unnatu-
ral.” For such people, these organs and their significance
are “mis-known” in Goethe’s sense. Such people might as
well oppose any and every kind of education for human
beings—because  that  too  goes  beyond  the  work  of  na-
ture—and should also be especially opposed to operating
on anyone who was born blind. What happens to a blind
person after a successful operation is very much like what
happens to those who awaken their higher senses in the
way described in the last section of this book. The world
now appears to them full of new qualities, new processes
and new facts that their physical senses never revealed.
They see clearly that there is nothing arbitrary or capri-
cious  about  supplementing  reality  through  these  higher
organs, and that without these organs the essential part of
this reality would have remained hidden from them. The
soul and spirit worlds are not “next to” or “outside” the
physical world, not separated from it in space. The for-
merly dark world is suddenly radiant with light and color
for a person born blind who has undergone an operation.
Similarly, the soul and spiritual qualities of things that un-
til now had appeared to us only in a purely physical way


[3]


are revealed when we are awakened in soul and spirit. Of
course this new world is also full of occurrences and be-
ings that remain totally unknown to anyone who has not
undergone  a  soul  and  spiritual  awakening.  (Later  on  in
this  book,  the  development  of  the  soul  and  spiritual
senses  will  be  discussed  in  greater  detail,  but  first  the
higher worlds themselves will be described. Those who
deny the existence of these worlds only demonstrate that
they have not yet developed their own higher organs. Hu-
man development is never complete at any given level; it
must always be taken further.)

We often tend, unintentionally, to imagine these higher
organs as being too much like our physical ones. It is im-
portant to remember that these organs are soul or spiri-
tual  formations  and  that  we  must  not  expect  what  we
perceive in the higher worlds to be only a misty and di-
luted form of material substance. As long as we expect
anything of that sort, we will not come to a clear idea of
what  is  actually  meant  here  by  “higher  worlds.”  Many
people would find it much easier to actually know some-
thing—at  first,  of  course,  only  the  elementary  facts—
about  these  higher  worlds  if  they  did  not  imagine  that
what they are to perceive is a highly refined version of
something physical. That they make this assumption usu-
ally means that they do not want to recognize what is re-
ally  involved.  They  find  it  unreal,  do  not  accept  it  as
something that could satisfy them, and so on. True, the
higher  levels  of  spiritual  development  are  difficult  to
reach, but the levels adequate for recognizing the nature
of the spiritual world—and that is already a lot—would


[4]

[5]


not be nearly as difficult to reach if people would first get
rid of the prejudice that makes them imagine that what is
of a soul and spiritual nature is simply a more refined ver-
sion of what is physical.

We obviously do not really know a person if we have
only an idea of his or her physical appearance, nor do we
really know the world around us if we know only what
our physical senses can tell us about it. A photograph be-
comes intelligible and full of life to us once we come to
know the person in the photograph so well that we know
his or her soul, and in the same way, we can really under-
stand the material world only once we know its soul and
spiritual basis. That is why it is good to talk first about the
higher worlds of soul and spirit, and only then come to
conclusions about the physical world from a spiritual sci-
entific point of view.

Certain difficulties are involved in talking about higher
worlds at the present stage of civilization. The greatness of
our age is due above all to its knowledge and mastery of
the  physical  world.  Our  very  words  bear  the  stamp  and
meaning of the physical world, and yet using these ordi-
nary words is our only possible link to what is familiar.
This leaves the door wide open for misunderstanding by
those willing to trust only their outer senses, since at first
much can be expressed or indicated only through compar-
ison and imagery. This, however, is how it has to be, be-
cause  such  images  are  a  means  of  directing  ourselves
toward these higher worlds and fostering our eventual ac-
cess  to  them.  (We  will  speak  about  the  ascent  to  higher
worlds in a later chapter in which the development of the


[6]


soul and spiritual organs of perception will be discussed.3
Indeed, to begin with, becoming aware of higher worlds
by means of comparisons is exactly what we should be do-
ing. Only then can we contemplate learning to see them for
ourselves.)

Just as the substances and forces that constitute and gov-
ern our stomach, heart, lungs, brain and other organs come
from the material world, our soul qualities—our urges, de-
sires,  feelings,  passions,  wishes,  sensations  and  so  on—
come from the soul world. The human soul is a member of
this soul world just as the body is a part of the physical
world. If we want to cite a preliminary difference between
the physical and soul worlds, we can say that the latter is
much  finer,  more  mobile  and  more  malleable  than  the
former. Meanwhile, of course, we have to realize that we
are entering a totally new world when we come to the soul
world, and that when we call things “coarser” or “finer” in
this context, we are drawing comparisons between things
that  are  actually  fundamentally  different.  The  same  ap-
plies to everything we can say about the soul world using
words borrowed from the physical. Taking this into con-
sideration, we can say that the formations and beings of
the soul world consist of soul substances and are guided by
soul forces just as is the case with physical substances and
forces in the physical world.

3.  These  spiritual  organs  of  perception,  also  discussed  brieﬂy  in  a
later  chapter  entitled  “The  Path  to  Knowledge,”  are  dealt  with  in
greater detail in my books How to Know Higher Worlds and Occult
Science.

Just as occupation of space and movement within space
are characteristic of physical forms, so are impelling de-
sires and responsiveness to stimuli characteristic of the
things and beings of the soul world. Thus we can also call
the  soul  world  the  world  of  desires,  wishes  or  longing.
These expressions are all borrowed from the world of the
human soul, so we must keep in mind that in parts of the
soul world lying outside the human soul, things are as dif-
ferent from the soul forces within the human soul as the
substances  and  forces  of  the  outer  physical  world  are
from  those  that  constitute  the  physical  human  body.
(“Urge,” “wish” and “longing” are terms describing the
soul world’s “material,” which we will call “astral sub-
stance.”  If  we  pay  more  attention  to  the  soul  world’s
forces, we can use the term “desire being,” but we must
not  forget  that  the  distinction  here  between  matter  and
force or energy cannot be as strict as it is in the physical
world. An urge can just as well be called a “force” as a
“substance.”)

These differences between the soul and physical worlds
can be bewildering for anyone looking into the soul world
for the first time, but the same is true when a previously
inactive physical sense opens and starts to function. After
eye  operations,  people  who  were  born  blind  must  also
learn to orient themselves in a world they used to know
only through the sense of touch. At first, they see the ob-
jects as if these were actually in their eyes; next they see
them outside their eyes, but as if painted on a flat surface.
Only  gradually  do  they  learn  to  perceive  depth  and  the
spatial distance between things.


The laws in effect in the soul world are entirely differ-
ent  from  the  ones  in  effect  in  the  physical  world,  al-
though  of  course  many  soul  formations  are  linked  to
those of the other worlds. The human soul, for example,
is linked to the human physical body and to the human
spirit, and the processes observable in it are influenced
by both the physical and spiritual worlds. We must take
this into account when observing the soul world, and we
must not make the mistake of attributing to a law of the
soul world what is actually due to the influence of one of
the  other  worlds.  For  example,  when  a  wish  proceeds
from a human being, it is carried by a thought, a spiritual
conception, whose laws it obeys. But just as we can es-
tablish what the laws of the physical world are by disre-
garding  the  influence  human  beings  have  on  its
processes,  for  example,  we  can  do  something  similar
with the soul world.

We can express an important difference between soul
and physical processes by saying that the interaction be-
tween soul processes is much more inward. In physical
space,  for  instance,  the  law  of  impact  is  in  effect.  If  a
moving ivory ball strikes another one at rest, the second
ball moves in a direction that can be calculated from the
motion and elasticity of the first. In soul space, however,
the interaction between two formations that meet depends
on their inner attributes. If they are related, they interpen-
etrate and grow together, so to speak. If their essential na-
tures  are  in  conflict,  they  repel  each  other.  To  take
another  example,  certain  laws  govern  the  way  we  see
things in physical space—distant objects appear reduced

[9]


[10]


in size. When we look down a long tree-lined street, the
trees in the distance, in accordance with the laws of per-
spective, appear closer together than the ones in the fore-
ground. But in soul space all things, near and far, appear
to the observer at distances from one another that are de-
termined  by  their  inner  nature.  Of  course  this  can  be  a
source  of  any  number  of  errors  for  anyone  who  enters
soul space and tries to get along using rules brought from
the physical world.

One of the first things we must learn in order to orient
ourselves in the soul world is to distinguish the different
types of formations, just as we distinguish between solid,
liquid  and  gaseous  bodies  in  the  physical  world.  To  do
this, we need to be aware of the two basic forces that are
all-important here, which may be called sympathy and an-
tipathy. How these fundamental forces work within a soul
formation determines its type. Sympathy is the force with
which  soul  formations  attract  each  other,  try  to  merge
with each other, and let their affinity take effect. Antipa-
thy, on the other hand, is the force through which soul for-
mations repel and exclude each other, and maintain their
own identity. The role a soul formation plays in the soul
world depends on the extent to which these basic forces
are present in it. First we must distinguish three types of
soul formations on the basis of how sympathy and antip-
athy act in them. These types differ in their specific inner
interrelationships of sympathy and antipathy, but both ba-
sic forces are present in all three.

When we look at a soul formation of the first type, we
find that it attracts other formations in its surroundings


by means of the sympathy at work within it. But in addi-
tion  to  this  sympathy,  antipathy  is  also  present  at  the
same time, causing the formation to repel certain things
in its surroundings. Seen from outside, this type of for-
mation appears to possess only antipathetic forces, but
that  is  not  the  case.  Both  sympathy  and  antipathy  are
present in it, but the latter is dominant. Formations like
this  play  a  self-centered  role  in  soul  space,  repelling
much  of  what  surrounds  them  and  lovingly  attracting
relatively little. Thus, they move through soul space as
unchangeable forms. The force of sympathy present in
them makes them appear greedy, and their greed appears
insatiable,  as  though  it  could  never  be  satisfied,  since
their  prevailing  antipathy  repels  so  much  of  what  ap-
proaches them that no satisfaction can occur. If we were
to compare soul formations of this type to something in
the physical world, we might say that they correspond to
solid physical bodies. This region of soul substance can
be called “burning desire.” The portion of this burning
desire that is included in animal and human souls deter-
mines what we know as their lower sensual urges, their
prevailing self-serving instincts.

In  the  second  type  of  soul  formation,  the  two  basic
forces are held in balance; that is, sympathy and antipathy
work equally strongly. Formations of this sort approach
others with a certain neutrality, acting as if they were re-
lated but without especially attracting or repelling them.
They  do  not  draw  any  fixed  boundaries  between  them-
selves and their surroundings, so to speak, and constantly
allow  themselves  to  be  influenced  by  other  formations


around them. For these reasons, they can be compared to
fluid substances in the physical world. There is no trace of
greed  in  the  way  such  formations  draw  others  toward
them. The kind of activity meant here is evident, for in-
stance,  when  the  soul  receives  a  sensation  of  color.  If  I
have the sensation of a red color, I am receiving a stimulus
from my surroundings, a stimulus that is neutral to begin
with. Only when my liking for red is added to the stimulus
does  another  soul  activity  enter  the  picture.  The  neutral
stimulus is caused by soul formations in which a balanced
interaction  between  sympathy  and  antipathy  is  main-
tained. We must describe the soul substance in question as
totally  malleable  and  flowing.  When  it  moves  through
soul space, it is not self-centered like the first type; its ex-
istence  is  constantly  receptive  to  impressions,  and  it
shows a relationship to much of what comes to meet it.
“Flowing  sensitivity”  is  a  term  that  might  be  applied  to
this second type.

In the third type of soul formations, sympathy predom-
inates  over  antipathy.  Antipathy  brings  about  self-cen-
tered self-assertion; in this case, however, it takes second
place to inclination toward things in the surroundings. We
can imagine a formation like this in soul space. It appears
as the center of a sphere of attraction reaching out over the
objects in its surroundings. An appropriate term for these
particular formations is “wish substantiality.” This seems
to be the right designation because the effect of the antip-
athy present in them, although it is weaker than the sym-
pathy, is to bring the objects the formation attracts into its
own sphere of influence, thus giving the sympathy in it a


[11]

[12]


fundamental note of self-seeking. This wish substantial-
ity can be compared to airy or gaseous bodies in the phys-
ical world, since it spreads out in all directions, just as a
gas naturally tries to expand on all sides.

The higher levels of soul substance are characterized
by the total withdrawal of one of the fundamental forces,
namely  antipathy; only  sympathy  exhibits  any  effec-
tiveness. It can now begin to assert itself within the parts
of  the  soul  formation  so  that  these  parts  attract  each
other. The force of sympathy within a soul body comes
to expression in what we call pleasure; any reduction in
sympathy is called displeasure. Displeasure is simply di-
minished pleasure, just as cold is diminished heat. Plea-
sure and displeasure constitute what lives in the world of
feelings—in the narrower sense—within a human being.
Feeling is the soul’s weaving activity within itself, and
what we call our “comfort” depends on how feelings of
pleasure and displeasure mingle in our soul.

A still higher level is occupied by the soul formations
whose sympathy is not confined to the domain of their
own lives. They, as well as the above-mentioned fourth
level, differ from the three lower levels in that the force
of sympathy no longer has any counteractive antipathy
to  overcome.  Only  through  these  higher  forms  of  soul
substance can the many different soul formations unite
into a common soul world. As long as any antipathy is
involved, a soul formation strives toward other things for
the sake of its own life, in order to strengthen and enrich
itself  through  the  other.  When  antipathy  is  silent,  the
other  is  received  as  revelation,  as  information.  In  soul


space,  this  higher  form  of  soul  substance  plays  a  role
similar  to  that  of  light  in  physical  space.  It  causes  one
soul formation to absorb the being and essence of others
for their own sake, or, as we might also put it, lets itself
be shone upon by them. Soul beings first awaken to true
soul  life  by  drawing  from  these  higher  regions.  Their
subdued life in the darkness opens up to the outside and
starts to shine and radiate out into soul space; their dull
and sluggish inner movement, which attempts to shut it-
self off by means of antipathy when only the substances
of  the  lower  regions  are  present,  is  transformed  into
power and mobility pouring out from within. The flow-
ing  sensitivity  of  the  second  region  comes  into  effect
only  on  contact,  when  soul  formations  meet,  in  which
case one flows over into the other. Actual contact is nec-
essary here. But in the upper regions a free outraying and
outpouring is the rule. (It is quite justified to characterize
the essence of this region as “raying out,” since the sym-
pathy developed here works in such a way that this ex-
pression derived from the working of light can surely
be used as its symbol.) A soul formation without the en-
livening  soul  substances  of  the  higher  regions  grows
stunted like a plant in a dark cellar. Soul light, active soul
power  and soul  life  itself—in  the  narrower  sense—be-
long to these regions and from here impart themselves to
the soul beings.

We must thus distinguish three lower and three upper
regions of the soul world and a fourth that mediates be-
tween  them,  yielding  the  following  subdivision  of  the
soul world:

[13]


1. Region of burning desire
2. Region of flowing sensitivity
3. Region of wishes
4. Region of pleasure and displeasure
5. Region of soul light
6. Region of active soul power
7. Region of soul life

[14]

[15]

In the first three regions, soul formations receive their
characteristic  qualities  from  the  inner  relationship  be-
tween antipathy and sympathy; in the fourth, sympathy
moves  and  works  within  a  soul  formation  itself;  in  the
three  highest  regions,  the  force  of  sympathy  becomes
ever freer. The soul substances of these highest regions
waft  through  soul  space,  enlightening  and  enlivening,
awakening what would, if left to itself, lose itself in its
own existence.

Although  it  should  be  unnecessary  to  mention  it  by
now,  let  us  emphasize  for  the  sake  of  clarity  that  these
seven divisions of the soul world do not represent distinct
and separate areas. Just as solid, fluid and gaseous sub-
stances  intermingle  in  the  physical  world,  burning  de-
sires, flowing sensitivity and the forces of the world of
wishes interpenetrate in the soul world. On the physical
level,  heat  penetrates  and  light  shines  on  bodies;  in  the
soul world, the same thing happens with pleasure and dis-
pleasure, and with soul light. Something similar is also
true of active soul power and soul life.


II. The Soul in the Soul World after Death

The human soul is the connecting link between the hu-
man spirit and the human body. Its forces of sympathy
and  antipathy—which  through  their  interplay  bring
about the soul’s expressions of desire, sensitivity, wish,
pleasure and displeasure, and so on—are not only active
between soul formations, but also express themselves in
relationship to the beings of the other worlds, the physi-
cal and the spiritual. While the soul is living in a body, it
participates to some degree in everything that goes on in
this body. When the functions of the physical body are
proceeding smoothly, pleasure and comfort arise in the
soul, but when these functions are disturbed, displeasure
and pain appear. But the soul also takes part in the spir-
it’s activities—one thought fills it with joy, another with
disgust; it applauds a correct judgment and disapproves
of a false one. A person’s level of development depends
on whether his or her soul leans more in the one direction
or in another. Individuals are the more nearly perfect the
more their souls sympathize with manifestations of the
spirit, the less perfect the more their souls’ inclinations
are satisfied through bodily functions.

The spirit is at the center of each human being, and the
body is the instrument through which the spirit observes
and knows, and also acts in, the physical world. The soul,
however, mediates between the two. For example, it re-
leases the sensation of tone from the physical impressions
that air vibrations make on the ear, and then it experiences
pleasure in this tone. It imparts all this to the spirit, which

[16]

[17]


grows in its understanding of the physical world as a re-
sult. A thought that appears in the spirit is converted by
the soul into the wish to bring the thought into being, and
only then—with the help of the bodily instrument—can
the  thought  become  an  accomplished deed.  We  human
beings can live up to our calling only by letting all of our
activity be directed by the spirit. Left to itself, the soul can
as easily turn its inclinations toward the physical world as
toward  the  spiritual;  its  “feelers,”  so  to  speak,  extend
down  into  the  physical  as  well  as  up  into  the  spirit.
Through this extension into the physical world below, the
soul’s own essential being is permeated and colored by
the nature of this physical world. And since the spirit can
only work in the physical world by means of the soul’s
mediation,  the  spirit  itself  points  in  the  direction  of  the
physical.  Its  formations  are  drawn  toward  the  physical
through the forces of the soul.

Consider undeveloped human beings. Their souls’ in-
clinations  are  closely  linked  to  their  bodily  functions.
They  experience  pleasure  only  through  the  impressions
the physical world makes on their senses. Even their men-
tal  activity  is  completely  drawn  down  into  this  sphere;
their  thoughts  serve  only  to  satisfy  the  needs  of  their
physical existence. But as the spiritual self proceeds from
incarnation to incarnation, its orientation is meant to be
provided increasingly by the spirit, its knowledge deter-
mined by the spirit of eternal truth and its activity by eter-
nal goodness.

[18]

Death  is  a  fact  of  the  physical  world  that  signifies  a
change in the functioning of the body. At death the body


ceases to be a vehicle for a soul and a spirit, and from
then on its functions become totally subject to the phys-
ical world and physical laws. It passes into the physical
world in order to disintegrate in it. Our physical senses
can observe only what happens to the body after death;
what  happens  to  the  soul  and  spirit  eludes  them.  Even
when  a  person  is  alive,  the  soul  and  spirit  can  be  ob-
served only to the extent that they take on an outer man-
ifestation  in  physical  processes.  After  death,  this  is  no
longer  possible.  Therefore,  sciences  based  on  physical
sense perception do not apply to the destiny of the soul
and  spirit  after  death.  At  this  point  a  higher  form  of
knowledge appears, a knowledge based on  the  obser-
vation  of  processes  taking  place  in  the  soul  and  spirit
worlds.

After  freeing  itself  from  the  body,  the  spirit  is  still
linked to the soul. Just as the body bound it to the physical
world  during  physical  life,  the  soul  now  binds  it  to  the
soul  world.  But  the  spirit’s  ultimate  being  is  not  to  be
found in this soul world, whose purpose is only to link it
to its field of activity, to the physical world. To be able to
reappear in more perfected form in a new incarnation, the
spirit  must  draw  energy  and  strength  from  the  spiritual
world. Through the soul, however, the spirit has been en-
tangled in the physical world, bound up with a soul being
permeated and colored by physical nature, and it also took
on this orientation itself.

After death, the soul is no longer bound to the body but
only to the spirit. It then lives in a soul environment, and
only the forces of this soul world can influence it. To begin

[19]


with, the spirit is bound to the soul’s life in the soul world,
just as it was bound to the body during physical incarna-
tion. The moment of the body’s death is determined by the
body’s  own  laws.  In  general,  the  soul  and  spirit  do  not
leave the body; it is rather dismissed by them4 when its
forces can no longer function as the human physical orga-
nization requires. The same thing applies to the relation-
ship  between  soul  and  spirit.  The  soul  will  release  the
spirit into the higher world, the spiritual world, when the
soul’s forces no longer function as the human soul organi-
zation requires. The spirit is set free as soon as the soul
surrenders  to  dissolution  everything  it  can  experience
only in the body, and retains only what is able to live on
with the spirit. This remainder, although experienced in
the body, can be imprinted on the spirit as the fruits of a
lifetime, and links the soul to the spirit in the purely spiri-
tual world.

To become familiar with the soul’s fate after death, we
must observe the process of its dissolution. Its task had
been to orient the spirit toward the physical, and as soon
as this task is fulfilled, the soul itself moves in the direc-
tion of the spiritual. Because of the nature of its task, it
would actually be immediately obliged to be only spiri-
tually active once the body falls away from it and it can

4. Publisher’s note: This passage reads, “they are rather dismissed by
it”  in  the  19th  (Stuttgart  1922)  through  26th  (Stuttgart  1948)  edi-
tions. In all editions since the 27th (Stuttgart 1955) the wording of
the 1st through 18th editions has been restored. It is not certain that
the  changes  introduced  in  1922  stem  from  the  author,  so  both  ver-
sions have been presented here.


no longer be a connecting link. This would happen if the
soul had not been influenced by the body for a whole life-
time and had not been drawn towards the body in its own
inclinations. Without the coloring it assumed through be-
ing bound up with the body, the newly disembodied soul
would  immediately  start  to  obey  only  the  laws  of  the
spirit and soul world. This would be the case if the person
in question had lost all interest in the earthly world before
dying, if all the desires, wishes and so on linking that
individual to the physical existence left behind had been
satisfied. But to the extent that this is not the case, what
remains of this orientation clings to the soul.

To avoid confusion at this point, we must clearly distin-
guish between something that binds a person to the world
in a way that can be resolved in a future incarnation, and
something that binds that individual to one particular in-
carnation, namely the most recent one. In the first case,
the situation is resolved by karma; in the second, it can
only be discarded by the soul after death.

For  the  human  spirit,  death  is  followed  by  a  time  in
which the soul strips itself of its inclinations toward phys-
ical existence so that it can once again obey only the laws
of the spirit and soul worlds and can set the spirit free. Of
course this takes longer in cases where the soul has been
more tightly bound to the physical. It takes little time in
cases of individuals who have not been very attached to
physical  life,  longer  in  cases  of  those  whose  interests
were totally bound up with that life and who therefore still
have many desires, wishes and so on present in their souls
at death.

[20]

[21]


[22]

[23]


Gaining an idea of the state in which the soul lives dur-
ing the time right after death will be easiest if we take a
fairly  crass  example—for  instance,  the  pleasure  of  a
gourmet. This pleasure, of course, is not of the body but
of the soul, in that both the pleasure and the desire for this
pleasure belong to the soul. However, satisfying this de-
sire  requires  the  corresponding  bodily  organs—palate,
taste buds and so on. After death, the soul does not imme-
diately lose its desire, but the physical organs that used to
be the means of satisfying it are no longer there. The per-
son  in  question  then  experiences  something  similar  to
suffering from extreme thirst in an area where there is no
water for miles around. (Although the reason for the suf-
fering is different, its effects are similar but much stron-
ger.) Because of the lack of the physical organs through
which pleasure was experienced, the soul suffers burning
pain at being deprived of this pleasure. The same applies
to any of the soul’s desires that can be satisfied only by
means of physical organs. This state of burning depriva-
tion  can  be  called  “the  place  of  desires,”  although  of
course it is not an actual place. It lasts until the soul has
learned to stop craving what can be provided only by the
body.

When  the  soul  enters  the  soul  world  after  death,  it  is
subject to the laws that prevail there, and their effects de-
termine  how  the  soul’s  inclination  toward  the  physical
will be eliminated. The effects will have to be different
according to the types of soul substances and forces in-
volved, but each type will make its cleansing and purify-
ing influence felt. The process is such that any antipathy


in the soul is gradually overcome by the forces of sympa-
thy, and the sympathy itself is taken to the ultimate de-
gree. At this highest level of sympathy toward all the rest
of the soul world, an individual soul merges with the rest,
so  to  speak,  becomes  one  with  it,  its  self-seeking  ex-
hausted.  It  ceases  to  exist  as  a  being  inclined  toward
physical, sensory existence, and through this the spirit is
set free. The soul undergoes purification in all the regions
of the soul world described previously, until in the region
of perfect sympathy it becomes one with the soul world
in general.

Because the spirit has spent a lifetime in intimate asso-
ciation with the soul, it is bound to it until the very last
moment of liberation. Having been directly linked to the
soul,  which  was  its  very  life,  the  spirit  is  much  more
closely  related  to  it  than  to  the  body,  to  which  it  was
linked  only  indirectly,  through  the  soul.  The  spirit  is
bound to the soul that is gradually freeing itself, but not to
the disintegrating body. Because it has a direct link to the
soul, the spirit can only feel free of the soul once the soul
has become one with the soul world in general.

As the human being’s residence during the time imme-
diately  after  death,  the  soul  world  can  be  called  the
“place  of  desires.”  The  different  religious  systems  that
have  incorporated  an  awareness  of  this  situation  into
their teachings know this “place of desires” under differ-
ent names such as “purgatory,” “the fire of purification,”
and so on.

[24]

The soul world’s lowest region is the region of burning
desire, where the soul’s crudest self-serving desires, those

[25]


relating to the lowest aspect of bodily life, are eliminated
after death. Through such desires, the soul can experience
the effect of this region’s forces. These forces take as their
point of attack all the unfulfilled desires that remain in the
soul from physical life. The sympathy in such a soul ex-
tends only to what will nourish its own self-seeking being,
and is far outweighed by the antipathy in it, which pours
out over anything else. However, after death its desires fo-
cus on physical pleasures that cannot possibly be satisfied
in  the  soul  world,  and  this  impossibility  intensifies  its
greed to the greatest possible degree. At the same time,
however,  this  impossibility  gradually  extinguishes  the
greed.  The  burning  lusts  and  desires  slowly  consume
themselves, and the soul learns from experience that elim-
inating these lusts is the only way to prevent the suffering
that must stem from them. During physical life such de-
sires  are  repeatedly  satisfied,  effectively  concealing  the
pain  of  burning  greed  behind  a  kind  of  illusion.  After
death, however, in the “fire of purification,” this pain is
fully exposed, and the corresponding deprivation must be
suffered to the full.

This  is  indeed  a  dark  state  of  affairs  for  the  soul.  Of
course,  only  individuals  whose  desires  focused  on  the
coarsest things in physical life fall into this state. Those
with few desires, on the other hand, have little connection
to the region of burning desire and pass through it without
noticing it. It must be stated that the souls spending the
longest time under the influence of this region are those
who became most related to its fire during physical life
and therefore have the greatest need to be purified in it.


Since the soul actually longs for its own purification after
death, we should not regard this purification as suffering
in the sense of any comparable experience in the world of
the senses. It is the only way the imperfection remaining
in the soul can be eliminated.

Processes of a second type take place in the soul world,
processes in which sympathy and antipathy are in balance.
A  human  soul  in  this  condition  will  be  influenced  after
death by these processes for a period of time determined by
the extent to which it gave itself in life to superficial frivol-
ities, to the pleasures of transitory sense impressions and to
the influence of daily trivialities that typify this condition.
People live in this condition as long as they are affected by
inclinations of this sort. They let themselves be influenced
by  every  daily  triviality,  but  the  influences  fade  quickly
since their sympathy is not extended to any one thing in
particular. Anything not belonging to this trivial realm is
antipathetic to them. After death, when a soul in this con-
dition lacks the sense-perceptible physical things needed
for satisfaction, the condition must slowly die off. Natu-
rally, the deprivation that prevails before it is fully extin-
guished in the soul causes suffering. In the school of this
suffering,  we  learn  to  destroy  the  illusions  in  which  we
wrapped ourselves during physical life.

Processes of a third type in the soul world are those in
which  sympathy  and  a  wish-like  character  prevail.  Our
souls  experience  the  effects  of  these  processes  through
everything that maintains an atmosphere of wishing after
death. This wishing, too, gradually dies off because of the
impossibility of satisfying it.

[26]

[27]


[28]

[29]


The  region  of  pleasure  and  displeasure  in  the  soul
world, designated above as the fourth region, subjects the
soul to special trials. As long as the soul occupies a body,
it takes part in everything that affects that body, such as
the interweaving of pleasure and displeasure that deter-
mines the body’s comfort and well-being, its discomfort
and displeasure. During physical life, a human being feels
the body to be the self, the basis of individual identity.
The more sensuous a person’s inclinations are, the more
his or her feeling of identity takes on this character. After
death, however, although the feeling of identity persists,
the body that was its object is gone, and as a result the
soul feels hollow and empty, as if it had lost itself. This
lasts until the recognition dawns that the true human be-
ing  is  not  physical  in  nature.  Thus  the  effects  of  this
fourth region destroy the illusion of the bodily self. The
soul learns to no longer perceive this bodily basis as es-
sential,  and  is  purified  and  cured  of  its  attachment  to
bodily  existence,  overcoming  what  used  to  bind  it  so
strongly to the physical world. It can now fully unfold the
forces of sympathy, which move outward. The soul has
broken free from itself, as it were, and is ready to pour it-
self actively into the soul world in general.

At this point, we should note that suicides, having left
their bodies by artificial means while the feelings bound
up with their bodies remain unchanged, undergo the ex-
periences of this region to an exceptional degree. When
death is due to natural causes, the disintegration of the
body is accompanied by the partial demise of the emo-
tions that cling to it, but for suicides, in addition to the


[30]


anguish caused by feeling suddenly hollowed out, all the
unsatisfied desires and wishes that prompted them to un-
dergo disembodiment in the first place are still present.
The  fifth  level  of  the  soul  world  is  the  level  of  soul
light. Here, sympathy for others already carries consid-
erable weight. Souls are related to this region to the ex-
tent that they took joy and pleasure in their surroundings
during physical life, rather than giving themselves up to
satisfying  their  lower  needs.  What  undergoes  purifica-
tion here includes, for instance, a sensuous over-enthusi-
asm  for  nature,  which  must  be  distinguished  from  a
loftier living-in-nature that is spiritual in character and
seeks the spirit that reveals itself in the things and pro-
cesses of nature. This higher feeling for nature is among
the things that contribute to the development of the spirit
and  establish  something  permanent  in  it;  this  must  be
distinguished  from  a  sense-based  pleasure  in  nature
which leaves the soul in need of purification as much as
any other inclinations based on purely physical existence
do.

Many people idealize practical arrangements that serve
our sensuous well-being, such as a system of education
that leads to sensuous comfort above all else. We cannot
say that these people are serving only their own self-cen-
tered impulses; nevertheless, their souls are still oriented
to the sense-perceptible world and must be cured of this
tendency by means of the power of sympathy that pre-
vails in the fifth region of the soul world, where any ex-
ternal  means  of  satisfaction  is  lacking.  Here,  the  soul
gradually recognizes that this sympathy must take other


directions;  sympathy  for  its  soul  surroundings  must
prompt the soul to pour itself out into soul space.

Those souls who expect their religious observances to
enhance their sensuous well-being are also purified here,
regardless of whether they yearn for an earthly or for a
heavenly  paradise.  They  find  this  paradise  in  the  soul
world, but only in order to recognize its worthlessness.
Of course,  these  are  all  only  individual  examples of
purifications undergone in this fifth region; many more
could be added.

The purification of the part of the soul that thirsts for
action takes place in the sixth region, or region of active
soul power. Although this action is not egotistical in char-
acter, it is still motivated by the sensuous satisfaction that
it provides. The kinds of people who develop this plea-
sure in activity give the outward appearance of being ide-
alists  and  self-sacrificing  individuals,  but  on  a  deeper
level they are still motivated by the heightening of sensu-
ous pleasure. Many artistic people, as well as those who
devote themselves to scientific activity for the pleasure of
it, belong in this region. What binds them to the physical
world is their belief that art and science exist for the sake
of such pleasure.

The seventh region, that of the actual soul life, frees us
from  our  last  inclinations  toward  the  sensory,  physical
world. Each preceding region has absorbed that aspect of
the soul that is related to it. All that is left surrounding
the spirit is the belief that its activity should be totally de-
voted to the physical world. Many extremely gifted peo-
ple  think  about  little  else  than  events  in  the  physical

[31]

[32]


world; their persuasion can be called “materialism.” In
the  seventh  region,  these  beliefs  must  be  and  are  de-
stroyed. Our souls realize that, in actual reality, a materi-
alistic point of view is without object, and their material-
istic beliefs melt away like ice in the sun. The being of
the  soul  is  now  absorbed  into  its  own  world,  and  the
spirit, free of all restraints, wings its way upward into re-
gions in which it lives only in its own element. The soul
has  completed  its  most  recent  earthly  task,  and  in  the
time that has elapsed since death, any aspects of this task
remaining as bonds for the spirit have dissolved. In over-
coming this last earthly remnant, the soul is returned to
its own element.

From what has been described, we can see that experi-
ences in the soul world and the circumstances of soul life
after death become less and less repellent as we dispose
of  more  and  more  of  what  still  clings  to  us  from  our
earthly  union  with,  and  affinity  for,  material  existence.
Depending on the circumstances created during its phys-
ical  life,  a  soul  will  belong  to  the  different  regions  for
longer or shorter periods of time. Wherever it feels an af-
finity, it remains until the affinity is wiped out, but where
no affinity exists, it passes through without feeling any of
the possible effects.

This section was intended to describe in broad strokes
only the most basic features of the soul world and the na-
ture of the soul’s life within it. The same is true of the fol-
lowing  description  of  the  country  of  spirit  beings.  To
describe  further  characteristics  of  these  higher  worlds
would go beyond the limits of this book. Without going

[33]


[34]


into  very  great  detail,  the  phenomena  in  these  higher
worlds that can be compared to spatial relationships and
time  spans  cannot  be  discussed  in  an  intelligible  way,
since these are all quite different from their counterparts
in the physical world. Some important points on this sub-
ject are included in my Occult Science.5

III. The Country of Spirit Beings

Before we can follow the spirit as it continues its journey,
we must first look at the territory it is entering. This is the
world of the spirit, and it is so different from the physical
world that everything we have to say about it will seem
sheer fantasy to those willing to trust only their physical
senses.  We  had  to  use  comparisons  and  imagery  to  de-
scribe the soul world, and that is even more the case here.
Our  language,  which  for  the  most  part  serves  only  the
purposes of sense-perceptible reality, is not exactly richly
endowed with expressions that can be applied directly to
the “country of spirit beings,” so it is especially important
to take much of what is said here as nothing more than in-
dications. Since everything described here is so different
from the physical world, this is the only possible way of
depicting it at all. Because of the inadequacy of our lan-
guage, which is intended for communication in the phys-
ical  world,  the  statements  being  made  here  can  only

1972).


[35]


crudely  correspond  to  actual  experience  in  the  spiritual
field.

It  must  be  emphasized  above  all  that  this  spiritual
world is woven out of the substance that constitutes hu-
man thought—“substance” in a very figurative sense, of
course. But thought as it appears in human beings is only
a shadowy image or phantom of its real being. A thought
appearing by means of a human brain corresponds to a
being in the country of spirit beings as a shadow on the
wall corresponds to the actual object casting the shadow.
But when our spiritual senses are awakened, we actually
perceive the thought being itself, just as our physical eyes
perceive  a  table  or  a  chair.  We  are  surrounded  and  ac-
companied  by  thought  beings.  Our  physical  eyes  per-
ceive  a  lion,  and  our  sense-oriented  thinking  perceives
the idea of the lion merely as a phantom, a shadowy im-
age. But in the country of spirit beings, the idea of the
lion is as real and visible to our spiritual eyes as the phys-
ical lion is to our physical eyes. The comparison we used
in connection with the soul world is also pertinent. Just
as people who were born blind but have had their sight
restored through operations suddenly perceive their sur-
roundings as having the new qualities of color and light,
those  who  have  learned  to  use  their  spiritual  eyes  per-
ceive their surroundings as filled with a whole new world
of living thoughts or spirit beings.

The first things to be seen in this world are the spiritual
archetypes of all the things and beings that exist in the
physical and soul worlds. If you imagine a painting as
existing in the spiritual world before the artist paints it,


you will have an image of what is meant by the term “ar-
chetype.” That the painter may not have this archetype
in mind before starting to paint, that he may only come
to it gradually as the painting is actually being worked
on, is beside the point. In the spiritual world, these ar-
chetypes exist for all things; physical things and beings
are copies or imitations of their archetypes. Quite under-
standably, people who trust only their outer senses will
deny  the  existence  of  this  archetypal  world  and  insist
that  archetypes  are  only  abstractions  that  the  intellect
works out by comparing sense-perceptible things. Such
people cannot perceive at all in this higher world; they
are aware of the world of thoughts only in its shadowy
abstractness. They do not know that individuals capable
of  spiritual  vision  are  as  familiar  with  spirit  beings  as
they themselves are with their dogs or cats, and that the
reality of the archetypal world is actually much more in-
tense than physical sense-perceptible reality.

It is true that looking into this country of spirit beings
for the first time is even more confusing than looking into
the soul world, because archetypes in their true forms are
very unlike their sense-perceptible copies, and they bear
equally  little  resemblance  to  their  “shadows,”  our  ab-
stract  thoughts.  In  the  spiritual  world,  everything  is  in
constant  activity,  constant  motion,  constant  creation.
“Resting” or “staying in one place” does not exist there
as it does in the physical world, simply because the arche-
types are creative beings, the master builders of every-
thing that comes into existence in the physical and soul
worlds. Their forms change quickly, and each archetype

[36]


[37]


has the potential to assume countless specific forms.6 It is
as if the specialized forms well up out of them—one form
has hardly been created before its archetype is ready to let
the next one pour out. In addition, archetypes do not work
alone, but stand in closer or more distant relationship to
each other. One archetype may need the help of another
to do its creating, and often innumerable archetypes work
together so that some particular being can come to life in
the soul world or the physical world.

In addition to what  can  be  perceived  by  means  of
spiritual  “sight” in the country of spirit beings, the expe-
rience of spiritual “hearing” must also be taken into ac-
count, for as soon as a clairvoyant ascends from the soul
world into the spirit, the archetypes also begin to resound.
This resounding is a purely spiritual process that must be
conceived of without any thought of physical sound. To an
observer, it is like being in an ocean of sounds and tones
in which the beings of the spiritual world are expressing
themselves.  Their  interrelationships  and  the  archetypal
laws  of  their  existence  reveal  themselves  in  the  chords,
harmonies,  rhythms  and  melodies  of  this  spiritual  “mu-
sic,” which reveals to our spiritual “ear” what reasoning

6. Although it is true that “[t]here is no such thing [in the spiritual
world] as ‘resting’ or ‘staying in one place’ as there is in the physical
world[,]” it would be incorrect to assume that the spiritual world is a
place of constant unrest. In this world where “the archetypes are cre-
ative beings,” although there is nothing that can be called “resting in
one place,” there is a peace of a spiritual kind that is totally compati-
ble with active mobility. The spiritual equivalent of “rest” is peaceful
contentment and bliss manifesting in activity rather than inactivity.


in the physical world perceives as an idea or natural law.
Hence the Pythagoreans called this perception of the spir-
itual  world  “the  music  of  the  spheres.”  To  those  with
functioning spiritual ears, this music of the spheres is no
symbol or allegory but a familiar spiritual reality. To ac-
quire  an  idea  of  this  spiritual  music,  we  must  dispense
with all our sensory concepts of music as we perceive it
by means of our material ears. Spiritual perception is in-
volved here, perception of a sort that remains silent for
the physical ear.

For simplicity’s sake, all references to “spiritual music”
will be omitted in the following descriptions of the country
of  spirit  beings.  We  must  imagine,  however,  that  every-
thing described as an image, as “shining” or “radiant,” is
also “sounding.” Every color, every sensation of light, cor-
responds to a spiritual tone; every interaction among col-
ors corresponds to a harmony or a melody, and so on. We
must  keep  in  mind  that  spiritual  seeing  does  not  cease
where spiritual sound prevails; the sounding simply aug-
ments the radiance. And where archetypes or archetypal
images are mentioned, we need to imagine primal tones as
well. Other modes of perception that could be called “spir-
itual tasting,” and so on, are also involved, but we will not
go into these processes now since the point is simply to
alert us to a conception of the spiritual world, taking cer-
tain modes of perception as examples.

First of all, we need to be able to distinguish between dif-
ferent kinds of archetypes. Here in the country of spirit be-
ings, as in the soul world, there are a number of different
levels or regions that we must be able to differentiate in

[38]


order  to  orient  ourselves.  Here,  too,  these  individual  re-
gions are to be imagined as if interpenetrating rather than
layered or piled on top of one another. The first region con-
tains the archetypes of things in the physical world that are
not endowed with life. The archetypes of minerals are to be
found here, and those of plants, but only to the extent that
they are purely physical, that is, to the extent that we do not
take their inherent life into account. In the same way, we
also find the physical forms of animals and human beings
here. This is not an exhaustive list of what is to be found in
this first region, but only a few illustrative examples.

This region constitutes the basic structure of the country
of  spirit  beings,  and  can  be  compared  to  the  solid  land
masses of our physical earth. It is the continental mass of
this spirit country. Of course, its relationship to the physical
bodily world can be described only by means of compari-
sons. We can get some idea of it as follows: Imagine a fi-
nite  space  filled  with  a  wide  variety  of  physical  bodies,
then imagine that the physical bodies are gone and visual-
ize hollow spaces of the same shapes in their places. Imag-
ine  that  what  used  to  be  the  empty  spaces  between  the
bodies is filled with a wide variety of forms that relate to
the former bodies in many different ways. This is some-
what similar to how things appear in the lowest region of
the world of archetypes: Things and beings that are embod-
ied in the physical world exist as hollow spaces here, and
the mobile activity of the archetypes and the spiritual music
goes on in between them. When the time comes for physi-
cal embodiment, the hollow spaces are then filled in with
matter, so to speak. Anyone looking into space with both


physical and spiritual eyes would see physical bodies, and
among them the mobile activity of the creative archetypes.
The second region of the country of spirit beings con-
tains the archetypes of life, but here this life forms a perfect
unity. It streams through the spiritual world like a fluid el-
ement, and is similar to blood in how it pulses through ev-
erything. It could be likened to the physical world’s oceans
and other bodies of water, although its distribution more
closely resembles that of the blood in animal bodies than
that of oceans and rivers. This second level of the country
of spirit beings might be described as “flowing life formed
from thought substance.” In this element are the creative
archetypal forces for everything that appears in physical
reality as enlivened being. It is apparent here that all life is
a unity, that the life within us as human beings is related
to the life of all our fellow creatures.

The archetypes of everything of a soul nature make up
the third region of the country of spirit beings. Here we
are in a much thinner and finer element than in the first
two regions, in an element that can be described, figura-
tively  speaking,  as  the  “atmosphere”  of  this  country  of
spirit beings. Everything taking place in souls in the two
other worlds has its spiritual counterpart here; all sensa-
tions,  feelings,  instincts,  passions  and  so  on  are  also
present here once again, but in spiritual form. The atmo-
spheric processes taking place in this “air” correspond to
the sorrows and joys of creatures in the other worlds—the
longing of a human soul appears as a light breeze, a pas-
sionate outbreak as a stormy blast. Those capable of visu-
alizing what is going on here can penetrate deeply into the

[39]


[40]

[41]


sighs of any ensouled being if they turn their attention to
it.  Here,  for  example,  we  can  talk  about  thunderstorms
with flashing lightning and rolling thunder; if we pursue
the matter further, we find that these spiritual storms ex-
press the passions of battles being fought on earth.

The  archetypes  of  the  fourth  region  do  not  relate  di-
rectly to the other worlds. In a certain respect, these ar-
chetypes  are  beings  that  govern  the  archetypes  of  the
three  lower  regions  and  mediate  their  coming  together,
ordering and grouping them. It follows that the activity
proceeding from this region is more encompassing than
that of the lower regions.

The fifth, sixth and seventh regions are fundamentally
different  from  the  previous  ones  because  the  beings  at
home in them provide the archetypes of  the  lower  re-
gions with the impulses required for their activity. There
the creative forces of the archetypes themselves are to be
found. When we can ascend as high as these three regions,
we become acquainted with the “intentions”7 underlying

7.  Terms like “intention” are used here in a metaphorical sense, as will
be  obvious  from  previous  discussion  of  the  difﬁculties  involved  in
expressing these things through language. Reviving the old teleologi-
cal  “doctrine  of  purpose”  is  not  what  is  intended.  The  terms  “pur-
poses” and “intentions” must be used here with regard to the driving
forces behind world evolution, even though this makes it tempting to
misinterpret  these  powers  in  terms  of  purposes  or  intentions  on  the
human  level.  This  temptation  can  be  avoided  only  by  raising  these
words to a new level of meaning where they can be free of anything
that would restrict them to the merely human level and can assume a
meaning  we  human  beings  approach  in  those  moments  in  our  lives
when we transcend ourselves to a certain extent.


our  world.  The  archetypes  lie  ready  here  like  germinal
points  of  life,  waiting  to  assume  the  various  forms  of
thought beings. When these germinal points are projected
into the lower regions, they immediately well up and man-
ifest in the most varied forms. The ideas through which the
human spirit appears creatively in the physical world are
reflections or shadows of these germinal thought beings of
the higher spiritual world. On ascending from the lower
regions  of  spirit  country  to  these  upper  ones,  observers
possessing the “spiritual ear” become aware that sounds
and tones are transformed into spiritual language; they be-
gin to perceive the “spiritual word” through which objects
and beings communicate their nature not only in music but
also in words, speaking out what can be called in spiritual
science their “eternal names.”8

We  must  imagine  these  germinal  thought  beings  as
composite  in  nature.  Only  the  germ  sheath,  which  sur-
rounds  the  actual  life  kernel  of  these  beings,  is  taken
from the elements of the world of thoughts. At this point,
we arrive at the limits of the three worlds, since the life
kernel itself has its origin in still higher worlds. When in
an  earlier  chapter  we  considered  the  human  being  as
made up of various component members, this life kernel
was  described  and  its  parts  called  the  “life  spirit”  and
“spirit body.” Other cosmic beings also have similar life
kernels  that  originate  in  higher  worlds  and  are  moved
into the three we have discussed in order to perform their
tasks there.

[43]


At this juncture, we will follow the human spirit as it
continues  its  pilgrimage  through  spirit  country  between
two incarnations or embodiments. As we do so, the cir-
cumstances and distinctive characteristics of this country
will once again become clear to us.

IV. The Spirit in Spirit Country after Death

Once  a  human  spirit  has  passed  through  the  world  of
souls on its journey between two incarnations, it enters
the country of spirits, where it remains until it is ready
for  a  new  bodily  existence.  We  can  understand  the
meaning of this stay in spirit country only if we are able
to interpret properly the purpose of our life’s pilgrimage
in an incarnation. While we are incarnated in physical
bodies, we human beings work and create in the physi-
cal world, but we work and create as spiritual beings.
What  we  imprint  on  physical  forms,  materials  and
forces  our  spirits  think  out  and  develop.  Our  task  as
messengers of the spiritual world is to incorporate the
spirit into the material world. Only through incarnating
in physical bodies can we work in the material world.
We must take on physical bodies as our tools so that we
have something material through which to work on the
material  world  and  through  which  the  material  world
can work on us. However, what works through our hu-
man bodily nature is the spirit. The intentions and di-
rections for our work in the material world come from
the spirit.


 As long as the spirit is active in a physical body, it can-
not  work  in  its  true  form  as  spirit,  but  can  only  shine
through the veil of physical existence, so to speak. In re-
ality,  our  human  thought  life  belongs  to  the  spiritual
world, but as it appears within our physical existence its
true form is veiled. We might also say that the thought ac-
tivity of physical human beings is a shadowy image, a re-
flection,  of  the  true  spiritual  being  to  which  it  belongs.
During physical life, the spirit interacts with the earthly
material world by using a material body as its basis.

It is true that one of the tasks of the human spirit, as
long as this spirit is proceeding from incarnation to in-
carnation, is to work in the physical world, but this task
could not be completed appropriately if the spirit lived
only an embodied existence. The intentions and goals of
an earthly task are no more worked out and determined
within  an  earthly  incarnation  than  the  blueprint  for  a
building comes about on the site where the builders are
already at work. The plan for the building is worked out
in the architect’s office, and the goals and intentions of
earthly endeavor are developed in the country of spirits,
where each human spirit must dwell again and again be-
tween incarnations in order to equip itself for work in a
physical lifetime. The architect draws up the plan for a
house in the office, according to architectural and other
standards, and does this without touching actual bricks
and  mortar.  Similarly,  the  architect  of  human  creativ-
ity—the  spirit  or  higher  self—develops  the  necessary
goals and capabilities according to the laws of the coun-
try of spirit beings, in order to then send them into the


earthly world. Only by returning again and again to its
own realm will a human spirit be able to bring the spirit
into the earthly world by means of its physical-material
instrument.

In the physical arena, we learn to know the characteris-
tics and forces of the physical world; while working, we
gather experience about what the physical world requires
of those who want to work in it. We also learn to know the
characteristics of the matter we intend to use to embody
our thoughts and ideas, although these ideas and thoughts
themselves cannot be derived from matter. Thus the phys-
ical world is the setting for both work and learning. After-
wards,  in  spirit  country,  what  has  been  learned  is
transformed into the active abilities and capacities of the
human spirit.

To make things clearer, the comparison we used above
can be taken further. An architect works out a design for
a house, and this plan is carried out. In the process, the
architect gains experience in a number of ways so that
his or her capabilities are enhanced. When the next de-
sign has to be drawn up, all these experiences flow into
it. The second design is enriched by everything learned
in the process of carrying out the first. It is the same with
successive human lifetimes. In the intervals between in-
carnations, the spirit is at home in its own realm and is
able to devote itself totally to the requirements of spiri-
tual life. Released from physical existence, it develops in
all directions and incorporates the fruits of its experience
in  previous  lifetimes  into  this  process.  Its  attention  is
thus always directed to the earthly context of its tasks. To


[44]


the extent that the earth is the spirit’s field of action, the
spirit is constantly working to keep pace with the earth’s
evolution, and is working on itself so that in each incar-
nation the service it performs corresponds to the earth’s
situation at that time. Of course, this is only a very gen-
eral picture of successive human lifetimes; reality never
conforms totally to this picture but only approximates it.
Circumstances  can  dictate  that  a  person’s  next  life  is
much  less  perfect  than  the  preceding  one,  but  on  the
whole  these  irregularities  are  balanced  out  within  pre-
cise limits in successive incarnations.

The course of our spirit’s development in the country of
spirit beings takes place through our becoming fully in-
volved in the life of each of its different regions. Our own
life dissolves into each region in succession; we tempo-
rarily assume the characteristics of each of these regions.
As a result, their being permeates our being so that we are
strengthened in our work on earth.

In the first region of the country of spirit beings, we are
surrounded by the spiritual archetypes of earthly things.
During  an  earthly  lifetime,  we  only  learn  to  know  the
shadows of these archetypes, which we grasp in our own
thoughts. What  is merely thought  on  earth  is experi-
enced in this region. We are surrounded by thoughts as
we proceed on our way, but these thoughts are real be-
ings.  What  we  perceived  through  our  senses  during
earthly life now works on us in its thought form, but the
thought appears to us, not as a shadow hiding behind the
things, but as a living reality that creates the things. We
are in the thought workshop, so to speak, where earthly


things are shaped and formed. Everything in the country
of spirits is full of lively activity and movement. Here the
thought world is at work as a world of living beings, cre-
ating and forming; we see here how what we experienced
during  earthly  existence  is  shaped  and  formed.  In  our
physical bodies we experienced sense-perceptible things
as  realities,  but  now,  as  spirits,  we  experience  spiritual
formative forces as real.

Also present among the thought beings here is the idea
of our own physical, bodily nature, from which we now
feel quite removed; we experience only our spiritual being
as actually belonging to us. When we do become aware, as
if in memory, of the body we have laid aside, we see it no
longer as a physical being but rather as a thought being,
and then the fact that it belongs to the outer world becomes
a direct observation. We learn to regard it as something be-
longing  to  the  outer  world,  as  an  extension  of  the  outer
world. As a result, we no longer consider our own physical
existence to be more closely related to ourselves, so we
cease to separate it from the rest of the world. We experi-
ence  the  entire  outer  world,  including  our  own  physical
embodiments, as a unity; our personal physical embodi-
ments merge into a unity with the rest of the world. At this
stage, we view the archetypes of physical, bodily reality as
a unity to which we ourselves once belonged. Through ob-
servation, we gradually learn to recognize our relationship
to, our unity with, our surroundings, to realize that we our-
selves once were what is spread out around us here.

This is one of the fundamental ideas of ancient Indian
Vedanta wisdom. The sage acquires during earthly life


what other people experience only after death, namely
the ability to grasp the thought that we ourselves are re-
lated to all things, the thought, “that is you.” In earthly
life this is an ideal that our thinking can aspire to, but in
the country of spirit beings it is an immediate fact that
becomes  ever  clearer  as  we  gain  spiritual  experience.
We become ever more aware that, in our essential be-
ing, we belong to the spiritual world. We perceive our-
selves as spirits among spirits, as organs of the primal
spirits. We feel in ourselves their word, “I am the primal
spirit,”  or,  in  terms  of  Vedanta  wisdom,  “I  am  Brah-
man,” that is, I am part of, an organ of, the primal being
from which all beings spring. Thus we see that what we
grasp during earthly life as a shadowy idea and the ob-
ject of all wisdom’s aspiration is a matter of direct ex-
perience  in  the  spirit  world.  This  idea  can  be  thought
during  earthly  life  only  because  it  is  an  actual  fact  in
spiritual existence.

During spiritual existence, we see the relationships and
circumstances that surrounded us during earthly life from
a more elevated vantage point, as if from outside. While
we live in the spirit country’s lowest region, this is how
we relate to earthly circumstances having to do directly
with physical, bodily reality. We are born on earth into a
family  and  an  ethnic  group,  and  we  live  in  a  particular
country.  All  these  circumstances  determine  our  earthly
existence. We find that the circumstances in the physical
world cause us to become friends with particular people
or to pursue a particular line of work; they determine the
general  character  of  our  life.  In  the  first  region  of  the

[45]


country of spirit beings, all this confronts us as a living
thought-entity. In a certain sense, we live through it all
again, but from the active spiritual side. Our love for our
family and the friendship we extended to others are now
enlivened in us from within, and our capacities in this di-
rection are enhanced. What works in the human spirit as
the  force  of  love  of  family  and  friends  is  strengthened,
and  in  this  respect,  we  later  enter  earthly  existence  as
more perfected human beings. For the most part, our daily
relationships in earthly life are what ripen into fruit in this
lowest region of the country of spirit beings. The aspect
of the human being that in its interests is wholly bound up
with these daily circumstances will feel related to this re-
gion for the greatest portion of the spiritual life between
incarnations.

The people with whom we lived in the physical world
are encountered again in the spiritual world. Just as ev-
erything that the soul once possessed through the physi-
cal  body  falls  away,  so  does  the  bond  that  once  linked
soul to soul in physical life free itself from the circum-
stances that only had meaning and reality in the physical
world. But what one soul was to another in physical life
lives  on  after  death,  lives  on  in  the  spiritual  world.  Of
course words coined to describe physical circumstances
can only inexactly express what takes place in the spiri-
tual world. Taking this into account, however, it is cer-
tainly  correct  to  say  that  souls  who  belonged  together
during physical life meet again in the spiritual world and
continue their lives together under the circumstances of
that world.


The next region is the one in which the life that is com-
mon  to  the  thought  being  of  the  entire  earthly  world
flows  and  streams  as  the  fluid  element  of  the  spiritual
world, so to speak. As long as we are observing the world
from the vantage point of physical embodiment, life ap-
pears bound to individual living things. In the country of
spirit  beings,  however,  life  is  released  from  individual
things and flows throughout like the blood of life, as a
living unity that is present in all things. During earthly
life we get only a glimmer or a reflection of this, which
is expressed in any devotion we bring toward the whole,
toward the unity and harmony of the world. Our religious
life derives from this reflection, making us aware of the
extent to which the comprehensive meaning of existence
does not  lie  in  anything  individual  and  transitory.  We
come to regard transitory existence as an image or like-
ness of something eternal, of a harmonious whole, and
we look up to this unity reverently and worshipfully in
performing our religious rituals. In the country of spirit
beings, however, living thought nature appears in its true
form rather than as a reflection, and we can actually unite
with the unity we worshiped on earth. Our religious life
and  everything  related  to  it  bears  fruit  in  this  region.
Here, spiritual experience teaches us that our individual
destinies  cannot  be  separated  from  the  community  to
which  we  belong, and the ability to recognize  our-
selves as parts  of  a  whole  develops.  Religious  feeling
and  everything  in  us  that  struggled  for  pure  and  noble
morality during our lifetime will draw strength from this
region during the greater part of the interval we spend in


[46]

[47]


it,  and  we  are  then  reembodied  with  our  abilities  en-
hanced in this regard.

In the first region, we were in the company of the souls
to  whom  we  were  most  closely  linked  in  the  physical
world in our previous lifetime. In the second region, we
come  into  the  presence  of  all  those  with  whom  we  felt
united  in  a  wider  sense  through  a  common  devotion,  a
common faith and so on. It must be emphasized that our
spiritual experiences in preceding regions continue in the
next,  so  we  are  not  torn  out  of  the  context  of  family,
friends and so on when we take part in the life of the sec-
ond and successive regions. The regions of the country of
spirit beings are not separate “departments”; they inter-
penetrate each other. We experience being in a new re-
gion  not  because  we  have  “entered”  it  in  any  outward
way,  but  because  we  have  only  now  acquired  the  inner
ability to perceive something that has been surrounding
us all the time.

The third region of the country of spirit beings contains
the archetypes of the soul world. Everything that lives in
that world is present here as a living thought being; we
find here the archetypes of desires, wishes, emotions and
so on. But no self-seeking clings to the soul here in the
spirit world. Just as all life constitutes a unity in the sec-
ond region, all desires, wishes, pleasures and displeasures
form a unity in this third region, so that what others wish
and desire is indistinguishable from what I wish and de-
sire. The sensations and feelings of all beings form a com-
mon world that encloses and surrounds everything else,
like the air that surrounds the earth. This region is,  so to


[48]


speak, the “atmosphere” of the country of spirit beings.
Everything done during earthly life in the service of the
common good and in selfless devotion to our fellow hu-
man beings will bear fruit here in this third region, be-
cause by living in service and devotion we were already
living  in  its  reflection.  Humankind’s  great  benefactors,
devoted individuals who perform great services for their
communities, acquired their ability to do so in this region
after  having  prepared  themselves  for  a  special  relation-
ship to it in earlier lifetimes.

Obviously, the three regions of spirit country that have
been  described  so  far  relate  in  a  particular  way  to  the
worlds  below,  to  the  physical  and  soul  worlds,  in  that
they contain the archetypes or living thought beings that
assume  physical  or  soul  existence  in  the  other  two
worlds. The fourth region is the first that is pure spirit
country, although not in the fullest sense of the word. It
differs from the three lower regions in that they contain
the archetypes of things and beings we find as “givens”
before we ourselves intervene in these worlds. Our ev-
eryday life on earth is related to these transient things,
which,  however,  direct  our  attention  to  their  basis  in
eternity. These transient things, and also our fellow crea-
tures  to  whom  we  turn  our  selfless  attention,  are  not
there because of us. But what is in the world because of
us  is  everything  created  through  the  arts  and  sciences,
through technology, the state and so on—everything we
incorporate into the world as original works of our spirit.
Without  our  participation,  no  image  of  these  things
would exist in the world. The archetypes for these purely


human creations are to be found in the fourth region of
the  country  of  spirit  beings.  Everything  human  beings
develop during earthly life by way of scientific accom-
plishments,  artistic  ideas  and  forms,  and  technological
thinking bears fruit in this fourth region. Artists, schol-
ars and great inventors draw their impulses from this re-
gion  during  their  stay  in  the  spirit  world;  here  their
genius is enhanced so that during later incarnations they
can contribute still more to the further development of
our civilization.

But we must not imagine that this fourth region is of
significance for outstanding individuals only; it is of sig-
nificance for all of us. Any concerns during physical life
that transcend the sphere of mundane activity, wishes and
desires  have  their  ultimate  source  in  this  region.  If  we
spent the interval between death and a new birth without
passing  through  this  region,  in  the  next  life  we  would
have no interests reaching beyond the narrow circumfer-
ence  of  our  own  personal  life  to  universal  human  con-
cerns. As it has just been said, not even this region can be
called  “pure  spirit  country”  in  the  fullest  sense  of  the
word,  because  the  condition  in  which  we  have  left  the
earth’s cultural development plays into our spiritual exist-
ence in this region.  In the  spiritual world we  can enjoy
only the fruits of whatever our own talents and the degree
of development of our ethnic group, nation and so on have
allowed us to achieve.

In the still higher regions of the country of spirit beings,
the human spirit is relieved of all earthly bonds and as-
cends to a purely spiritual world, where it experiences the

[49]


intentions and goals it established for earthly life. Every-
thing that is actually achieved in the world brings these
highest  goals  and  intentions  into  existence  only  in  the
form of a relatively feeble copy. Every crystal, every tree,
every animal, and also everything we accomplish through
our own creativity—all these provide only copies of what
the spirit intended. During our incarnations, all we can do
is link up with these imperfect copies of perfect intentions
and goals. We ourselves can only be copies or imitations
of what the kingdom of the spirit intended us to be. There-
fore, what we actually are as spirits in the country of spirit
beings is only evident once we have reached the fifth re-
gion of spirit country during the interval between two in-
carnations.  Here  we  are  really  ourselves;  we  are  what
assumes  outer  existence  in  our  various  incarnations.  In
this region our true human self, the self that appears anew
in each incarnation, can come to full expression. Since it
brings  with  it  abilities  that  have  matured  in  the  spirit
world’s lower regions, it carries the fruits of earlier life-
times over into succeeding ones. It is the vehicle for the
results of earlier incarnations.

When  the  self  is  in  the  fifth  region  of  the  country  of
spirit beings, it dwells in the kingdom of intentions and
goals.  In  the  fifth  region,  like  an  architect  who  learns
from imperfections that have become evident and who in-
cludes in future designs only what he or she has been able
to perfect, the self discards any of the results of experi-
ence  in  earlier  lifetimes  that  have  to  do  with  lower-
worldly imperfections. It is now at home with the inten-
tions of the country of spirit beings and fructifies them

[50]


with the results of earlier lifetimes. Clearly, the strength
that can be drawn from this region depends on the extent
to which the embodied self has achieved results that are
fit to be taken up into the world of intentions. A self that
has  attempted  to  realize  the  intentions  of  the  spirit  by
means of its active thought life or wise and loving work
during earthly life will be a good candidate for this region.
On  the  other  hand,  nothing  that  is  totally  given  over  to
mundane  circumstances,  nothing  that  dwells  on  and  in
transitory things, can sow seeds capable of playing any
role in the purposes of the eternal order of the world. Only
those few things that have had an effect extending beyond
everyday interests can develop into fruit in these upper re-
gions of the country of spirit beings.

However, we must not imagine that worldly renown or
any such thing is what is meant here. It is rather a question
of anything, even in the most restrictive life situation, that
leads to an awareness of each single thing’s importance in
the eternal progressive course of existence. In this region,
we must become accustomed to assessing things differ-
ently than we are able to do in physical life. For instance,
if we have acquired very little that relates to this fifth re-
gion, we feel an urgent need to imprint on ourselves an
impulse that will cause our next life to run its course in
such a way that the effect of this deficit becomes apparent
in  the  destiny  or  karma  we  meet.  The  “unfortunate
fate”—to put it in terms of that lifetime—that meets us
there, and that may even provoke bitter complaining, ap-
pears in the fifth region as exactly what we need. Since in
this fifth region we are dwelling in our true self, we are


raised above everything lower-worldly that enveloped us
during  our  incarnations.  Here,  we  are  what  we  always
have been and always will be in the course of our incar-
nations.  We  are  living  under  the  authority  of  the  inten-
tions that exist for these incarnations, intentions that we
incorporate into our own self. That is, we look back on
our past and are aware that everything we have experi-
enced is being absorbed into intentions that we will have
to realize in future. A certain capacity to remember earlier
lifetimes  as  well  as  a  prophetic  preview  of  later  ones
flares up. We know that what this book calls the “spirit
self,” to the extent that it is already developed, is in its
own element in this region, where it continues to develop
and prepares itself to be able to fulfill spiritual intentions
in earthly reality in a new incarnation.

If, through a series of sojourns in the country of spirit be-
ings, this “spirit self” has developed to the point where it
can  move  about  totally  freely  there,  it  will  seek  its  true
home there more and more in times to come. Life in the
spirit becomes as familiar to it as life in physical reality is
to earthly human beings. At this stage of development, the
viewpoint  of  the  spiritual  world  begins  to  prevail  as  the
one the self chooses more or less consciously as the stan-
dard  for  its  earthly  lives  to  come.  It  feels  itself  to  be  a
member of the world’s divine order, and the laws and lim-
itations  of  earthly  life  do  not  touch  its  innermost  being.
The  strength  needed  for  everything  that  it  carries  out
comes from the spiritual world. But this spiritual world is
a unity, and those who live in it know that the eternal has
worked to create the past. They are also able to determine

[51]


their future direction in accordance with the eternal; their
view, once restricted to the past, has expanded and become
perfect.9 Human beings who have reached this level pro-
vide for themselves the goals they are to achieve in their
next incarnation. Working out of the country of spirit be-
ings, such human beings influence their own future so that
it proceeds in line with what is true and spiritual. Because
they have climbed to the level where they can understand
divine wisdom, these human beings spend the intervals be-
tween incarnations in the presence of all the exalted beings
who have an unrestricted view of that wisdom.

9. The statement that “[t]hey are also able to determine their future
direction in accordance with the eternal[,]” is intended to point to the
special character of the soul’s constitution during the time between
death and a new birth. By the standards of life in the physical world,
a  stroke  of  destiny  in  the  life  of  an  individual  may  seem  to  be  in
direct conﬂict with what that person wants and intends. During life
between  death  and  birth,  however,  a  will-like  force  that  prevails  in
the human soul points the way for the person in question to experi-
ence that very blow of fate. The soul perceives, as it were, an imper-
fection clinging to it from previous earthly lives as a result of some
ugly deed or thought. During the interval between death and birth, a
will-like  impulse  that  arises  in  the  soul  urges  it  to  balance  out  this
imperfection.  As  a  result,  the  soul  acquires  the  tendency  to  plunge
into some misfortune in its subsequent earthly life, something it must
suffer  in  order  to  restore  equilibrium.  Once  it  has  been  born  into  a
physical body and hit by this stroke of destiny, the soul in question
has  no  inkling  that  in  its  pre-birth  life  in  the  spirit  it  had  actively
pushed itself in the direction of this hard fate, but in actual fact—as
unwished for and unintended as this blow may seem from the view-
point of earthly life—the soul has willed it upon itself in the course
of its supersensible existence. “Out of eternity, human beings deter-
mine their future.”


In the sixth region of the country of spirit beings, every-
thing  that  human  beings  do  brings  about  what  is  best
suited to the true and essential nature of the world. Hu-
man beings can no longer seek what is to their own ad-
vantage,  but  only  what  should  happen  according  to  the
proper progression of the world order.

The  seventh  region  of  the  spirit  world  leads  to  the
boundary of the three worlds we have discussed. Here, hu-
man beings stand face to face with the “kernels of life” that
are transplanted from still higher worlds into these three
where they will complete their tasks. Having arrived at the
limits of the three worlds, human beings recognize them-
selves in their own “kernels of life.” This means that the
riddles of these three worlds have been solved for them;
they  have  acquired  a  full  overview  of  the  life  in  these
worlds. Under ordinary circumstances in physical life, the
soul faculties by which we experience the spiritual world
in the way described here do not become conscious. They
work  in  unconscious  depths  on  the  physical  organs  to
bring about consciousness in the physical world, and thus
they  remain  imperceptible  as  far  as  this  world  is  con-
cerned. An eye, too, is incapable of seeing itself because
the forces that make it possible to see other things are at
work in it. If we want to assess the extent to which a hu-
man  life  between  birth  and  death  is  the  result  of  earlier
earthly lives, we must take into account the fact that a van-
tage point situated within this life itself does not allow us
to do so. From this point of view, an earthly life might ap-
pear to be imperfect, full of suffering and so on, while to a
point of view based outside earthly life, the form this life


assumes in all its suffering and imperfection would prove
to be the consequence of earlier lives. By setting out on the
path to knowledge as it is described in a subsequent chap-
ter of this book, the soul can free itself from the circum-
stances  of  bodily  life  and  perceive  an  image  of  the
experiences it undergoes between death and a new birth.
This type of perception makes it possible to depict the pro-
cesses taking place in the spirit world, as has been done
here in a sketchy form. Only when we remember that the
soul’s entire constitution is different in the physical body
than  it  is  when  it  is  undergoing  purely  spiritual  experi-
ences, can we see these depictions in the right light.

V. The Physical World and its Connection
to the Worlds of Souls and Spirits

[52]

The formations of the soul and spirit worlds cannot be the
object of outer sensory perception. Sense-perceptible ob-
jects  must  be  reckoned  as  a  third  world  alongside  the
other two. During bodily existence, we live in all three
worlds at once: We perceive the objects of the sense-per-
ceptible world and work on them. Soul structures work
on  us  through  their  forces  of  sympathy  and  antipathy,
while we ourselves stir up waves in the soul world with
our likes and dislikes, wishes and desires. The spiritual
nature  of  things,  however,  is  reflected  in  our  thought
world, and as thinking spirit beings we are citizens of the
country of spirit beings and comrades of everything that
lives in this realm.


This makes it clear that the sense-perceptible world is
only part of what surrounds us. It is distinct from, and to
a certain extent independent of, our overall surroundings
simply because it can be perceived with senses that disre-
gard the soul and spiritual aspects of these surroundings.
It is like a piece of ice floating on water—the ice consists
of the same substance as the surrounding water but stands
out because of certain qualities it possesses. In the same
way, sense-perceptible things are of the same substance
as the soul and spirit worlds surrounding them, but they
stand  out  because  of  certain  characteristics  that  make
them perceptible to our senses. To put it somewhat figu-
ratively,  they  are  condensed  spirit  and  soul  formations,
and the condensation makes it possible for our senses to
acquire knowledge about them. Ice is just one of the man-
ifestations of water, and sense-perceptible things are just
one  form  in  which  soul  and  spirit  beings  exist.  Having
grasped this, we can also understand that the spirit world
can change into the soul world and the soul world into the
sensory world, just as water can turn to ice.

From  this  perspective,  it  also  becomes  clear  why  we
human beings are able to think thoughts about sense-per-
ceptible things. Every thinking person must ask the ques-
tion,  “What  is  the  relationship  of  my  thoughts  about  a
stone to the stone itself?” For people who are able to look
into  nature  especially  deeply,  this  question  appears
clearly to their mind’s eye; they experience the world of
human thoughts as being in harmony with the structure
and order of nature. Kepler, the famous astronomer, put it
very beautifully:

[53]


The  truth  is  that  the  divine  calling  that  bids  us
study  astronomy  is  inscribed  on  the  world  itself,
not in words and syllables but in the very fact that
our human concepts and senses are adapted to per-
ceive  how  heavenly  bodies,  heavenly  circum-
stances, are linked.10

  Only  because  sense-perceptible  things  are  nothing
other  than  condensed  spirit  beings  can  we  human  be-
ings—who can lift ourselves up in thought to the level of
spirit  beings—think  about  and  understand  them.  Sense-
perceptible  things  originate  in  the  spirit  world  and  are
simply  another  manifestation  of  spirit  beings;  when  we
formulate thoughts about things, we are simply inwardly
directed away from their sense-perceptible forms and to-
ward their spiritual archetypes. Understanding an object
by thinking about it is a process that can be compared to
melting a solid body so that chemists can study it in its
fluid form.

The spiritual archetypes of the sense-perceptible world
are to be found in the different regions of spirit country.
In the fifth, sixth, and seventh regions, they still exist as
living  germinal  points,  while  in  the  four  lower  regions
they take shape as spiritual formations. When the human
spirit tries to come to an understanding of sense-percepti-
ble  objects  by  means  of  thinking,  it  perceives  shadowy
copies or imitations of spiritual formations. In aspiring to

10.  Johannes  Kepler,  1571-1630.  This  passage  is  from  the  “Com-
mentaries” on his book Astronomia Nova, Part II, Chapter VII.

[54]


a  spiritual  understanding  of  our  surroundings,  we  raise
the  question  of  how  spiritual  formations  condense  into
sense-perceptibility.

To our sensory perception, the world around us is di-
vided into four clearly distinguishable levels, the mineral,
plant, animal and human levels. The mineral kingdom is
perceived  by  means  of  the  senses  and  understood  by
means of thinking. When we formulate a thought about a
mineral object, we are dealing with two things, the sense-
perceptible object and the thought. Accordingly, we must
imagine  this  sense-perceptible  thing  as  a  condensed
thought being. Now, one mineral entity acts outwardly on
another; it bumps into it and makes it move, warms it, il-
luminates it, dissolves it, and so on. This outward way of
working can be expressed in thoughts. In the process of
having  thoughts  about  how  mineral  objects  influence
each other in a regular and lawful manner, our isolated
thoughts expand into a thought image of the whole min-
eral world. This thought image is a reflection of the arche-
type  of  the  entire  mineral  sense-perceptible  world,  and
can be found as a whole in the spiritual world.

In the plant kingdom, the phenomena of growth and re-
production are added to the fact that one thing outwardly
affects  another.  Plants  grow  and  produce  beings  of  the
same  kind,  so life  is  added  to  what  we  encounter  in  the
mineral  kingdom.  Simply  pondering  this  state  of  affairs
will lead us to a point of view that sheds light on the sub-
ject. Each plant possesses the inherent power to create its
own living form and to pass it on to a being of its own kind.
The forms of crystals stand midway between  mineral


substances of the formless sort, such as those we encounter
in  gases,  liquids,  and  so  on,  and  the  living  forms  of  the
plant  world.  In  crystals  we  find  the  transition  from  the
formless mineral world to the living capacity of the plant
kingdom to produce forms. The outward sense-perceptible
process  of  assuming  shape,  as  it  takes  place  in  both  the
mineral and plant kingdoms, must be seen as a sense-per-
ceptible condensation of a purely spiritual process that oc-
curs when the spiritual germinal points of the three upper
regions  of  the  country  of  spirit  beings  develop  into  the
spirit formations of the lower regions. The spiritual arche-
type  of  crystallization  is  the  transition  from  a  formless
spirit germ point to a spiritual formation with a shape. If
this transitional process condenses to the point where our
senses can perceive its result, it manifests in the sense-per-
ceptible world as the process of mineral crystallization.

In the plant world, too, a spirit germ that has assumed
form is present, but in this case the formed being retains
the living sculptural ability that the crystal’s spirit germ
lost when it took on shape, exhausting its life in the for-
mation it produced. In contrast, plants possess both form
and  the  ability  to  go  on  forming;  this  characteristic  of
spirit germs is retained from the spiritual world’s upper
regions. Thus, a plant is both form, like the crystal, and
formative  force.  In  addition  to  the  form  that  archetypal
beings  assume  in  the  shape  of  a  plant,  the  plant  is  also
worked  upon  by  another  form  that  bears  the  imprint  of
spirit beings from the upper regions. However, the only
aspect  of  the  plant  that  is  sense-perceptible  is  what  ex-
presses itself in the completed form; the formative beings


that  give  this  form  its  life  are  present  within  the  plant
kingdom  without  being  perceptible  to  our  senses.  Our
physical eyes can see a lily that is first small, then larger,
but they cannot see the sculpting force that makes it grow.
This sculpting force-being is the invisibly active compo-
nent  of  the  plant  kingdom.  Spirit  germs  have  stepped
down one level in order to work in the realm of forma-
tions.  If  we  call  the  archetypal  forms  that  have  not  as-
sumed  specific  shape  the first  elemental  kingdom,  then
the force-beings that are invisible to our senses and that
work at sculpting the growth of plants belong to the sec-
ond elemental kingdom.

In the animal world, the ability to grow and reproduce
is augmented by sensations and impulses. These are man-
ifestations  of  the  soul  world.  Any  being  endowed  with
them  belongs  to  the  soul  world,  receives  impressions
from it and exerts an influence on it. Now, every sensa-
tion or impulse that comes about in an animal is brought
up from the depths of the animal’s soul. However, the an-
imal’s form is more lasting than these sensations or im-
pulses. We might say that the animal’s sentient activity
compares  to  its  more  permanent  enlivened  form  as  the
changeable form of a plant compares to the fixed form of
a crystal. The plant, so to speak, is totally taken up with
the  force  that  sculpts  forms.  It  continues  to  incorporate
different  forms  throughout  its  life  as  it  produces  first
roots, then leaves, then flowers, and so on. In contrast, the
animal has a finished form within which it develops an
ever-changing life of sensations and impulses. This life
exists in the soul world. Plants grow and reproduce, while


animals perceive, feel, and develop impulses. For the an-
imal, these impulses are something formless that evolves
through ever new forms. Ultimately, the archetypal pro-
cesses of these impulses are to be found in the highest re-
gions of the country of spirit beings, but they are active
and at work in the soul world.

In animals, then, in addition to the force-beings invisi-
bly at work directing growth and reproduction, others are
also present that have descended one stage deeper into the
soul  world.  In  the  animal  kingdom,  sensations  and  im-
pulses are crafted by formless beings that slip into soul
garments. These are the actual architects of animal forms.
In spiritual science, the realm to which they belong can be
called the third elemental kingdom.

We human beings are equipped not only with the capa-
bilities characteristic of plants and animals, but also with
the  ability  to  develop  sensations  into  concepts  and
thoughts  and  to  govern  our  impulses  with  thinking.
Thought, which appears as form in plants and as soul fac-
ulties in animals, appears in human beings in its real form,
as  thought  itself.  Animals  are  soul;  human  beings  are
spirit. The spirit being shapes the soul in an animal; in a
human being, it descends one step further into the sense-
perceptible world of matter itself. The spirit is present in
sense-perceptible  garb  within  the  physical  human  body
and can thus appear only as a spirit being’s shadowy re-
flection as thought represents it. The spirit appears within
a human being under conditions imposed by the physical
organization  of  the  human  brain.  However,  it  also  be-
comes the inner being of a human individual.


In  human  beings,  the  form  assumed  by  the  formless
spirit  being  is  thought,  while  in  plants  it  assumes  the
guise of form and in animals, that of the soul. Therefore,
to the extent that we humans are thinking beings, there is
no elemental kingdom building us up from outside. Our
elemental kingdom works in our sense-perceptible body,
and only to the extent that we are formed and sentient be-
ings do the elemental beings work on us in the way they
work on plants and animals. Our thought organization,
however,  is  worked  on  only  from  within  our  physical
body.  In  our  spiritual  organs,  in  our  nervous  system
which culminates in a perfected brain, we are confronted
in sense-perceptible form with what works impercepti-
bly, as a force-being, on plants and animals. This means
that animals feel themselves, but human beings are con-
scious of themselves. In animals, the spirit experiences
itself as soul but does not yet grasp itself as spirit. In hu-
man beings, however, the spirit recognizes itself as such,
although physical circumstances permit it to appear only
as a shadowy reflection of the spirit, as thought.

Accordingly, the threefold world falls into the follow-

ing subdivisions:

I. The kingdom  of archetypal formless  beings (ﬁrst

elemental kingdom);

II.  The  kingdom  of  form-creating  beings  (second

elemental kingdom);

III.  The  kingdom  of  soul  beings  (third  elemental

kingdom);


IV. The kingdom of created forms (crystal forms);

V.  The  kingdom  of  sense-perceptible  forms
worked  on  by  the  form-creating  beings  (plant
kingdom);

VI.  The  kingdom  of  sense-perceptible  forms
worked on by both the form-creating beings and
the  beings  that  express  themselves  as  soul  (ani-
mal kingdom);

VIII.  The  kingdom  of  sense-perceptible  forms
worked  on  by  form-creating  and  soul  beings,
and in which the spirit appears in the sense-per-
ceptible  world  in  the  form  of  thought  (human
kingdom).

[55]

This demonstrates how the constitutional components
of an embodied human being relate to the spiritual world.
Physical body, ether body, sentient soul body and mind
soul are to be regarded as condensations in the sense-per-
ceptible world of archetypes in the country of spirit be-
ings.  The  physical  body  comes  about  through  the
condensation  of  the  human  archetype  to  the  point  of
sense-perceptibility,  so  we  can  also  call  this  physical
body a being of the first elemental kingdom condensed to
the level of physical perceptibility. The ether body comes
about when a form of the same origin remains mobile be-
cause of a being that extends its activity into the realm of
sense-perceptibility  but  does  not  become  perceptible  it-
self. To characterize this being fully, we must say that it
has its ultimate origin in the highest regions of the country


of spirit beings and then takes shape in the second region
as an archetype of life, which then works in the sense-per-
ceptible world. In a similar way the being that builds up
the sensing soul body also originates in the highest spirit
regions, but takes shape in the third region as an arche-
type of the soul world and as such becomes active in the
sense-perceptible world. The mind soul, however, comes
about when the archetype of a thinking human being as-
sumes the form of thought in the spirit world’s fourth re-
gion and as such works directly in the sense-perceptible
world.

This  then,  is  how  we  human  beings  stand  within  the
physical  world,  how  the  spirit  works  on  our  physical,
ether  and  soul  bodies  and  makes  its  appearance  in  our
mind  soul.  Our  three  lower  members  are  thus  worked
upon by archetypes in the form of beings that are external
to us in a certain sense, but in our mind soul we begin to
work consciously on ourselves. The beings that work on
our physical body are the same ones that shape the min-
erals in nature. The ones that work on our ether body are
the same kind as those that live in the plant kingdom, and
the ones that work on our sentient soul body are the same
kind as those that are active in the animal kingdom; both
are invisible to sensory perception but extend their influ-
ence into these kingdoms.

We have now seen how the different worlds work to-
gether and how their working together expresses itself in
the world in which we human beings live.

[57]


Having understood the sense-perceptible world in this
way, we are also open to understanding beings different
from the ones that exist within the four kingdoms of na-
ture. One example of this type of being is what we call
our folk spirit, the spirit of our ethnic group or nation.
This being does not appear directly in any sense-percep-
tible way. It lives and expresses itself in the sensations,
feelings, inclinations, and so on, that we perceive as be-
ing shared by an entire ethnic group. It is a being that
does not incarnate perceptibly as human beings do, but
fashions its body out of the substances of the soul world.
The soul body of the ethnic spirit surrounds the mem-
bers of an ethnic group like a cloud in which they live;
its influence becomes apparent in the souls of the indi-
viduals  in  question,  but  it  does  not  originate  in  these
souls. If we do not conceive of the ethnic spirit in this
way,  it  will  remain  an  empty  abstraction,  a  schematic
mental image devoid of life and being. Another example
of  this  type  of  being  is  what  we  call  the Zeitgeist,  or
spirit of an age. Indeed, our spiritual view widens to en-
compass  a  multitude  of  different  higher  and  lower  be-
ings  that  live  in  our  surroundings  without  becoming
perceptible to our senses. However, those who are capa-
ble of spiritual perception do perceive these beings and
can describe them.

The  lower  beings  of  this  sort  include  all  those  de-
scribed  by  seers  as  salamanders,  sylphs,  undines  and
gnomes. It should be unnecessary to mention at this point
that  such  descriptions  cannot  be  taken  as  literal  depic-
tions  of  the  underlying  reality.  If  they  were,  the  world


they refer to would not be a spiritual world but a crudely
physical one. In fact, they illustrate a spiritual reality that
can only be described by using metaphors and images.
Individuals who accept sensory perception alone as valid
will believe these beings to be the product of superstition
and  of  an  imagination  run  wild.  This  is  totally  under-
standable.  These  beings  will  never  become  visible  to
physical eyes because they have no physical bodies. The
superstition, however, lies not in believing these beings
are real but in believing that they appear sense-percepti-
bly. Beings of this sort help to build up the world, and we
encounter them as soon as we enter higher territories that
are inaccessible to our physical senses. The truly super-
stitious people are not those who take these descriptions
as images of spiritual realities, but both those who be-
lieve  in  their  actual  physical  existence  and  those  who
deny the spirit because they feel obliged to reject the sen-
sory images.

Beings  also  exist  who  never  descend  into  the  soul
world at all, but whose garments are woven out of the
configurations of the country of spirit beings. We per-
ceive them and become their companions when our spir-
itual  eyes  and  ears  have  been  opened  to  them.  This
process enables us to understand many things we could
formerly  only  stare  at  in  total  incomprehension.  Light
dawns around us;  we see the causes of  the  effects  and
consequences that are played out in the physical world.
We grasp things that formerly, when we lacked spiri-
tual eyes, we either had to deny totally or dismiss with
the saying, “There is more in heaven and earth than is


dreamed of in your philosophy.” People with a finer (that
is, spiritual) sensitivity grow restless when they begin to
be dimly aware of the presence of a world in addition to
the  sense-perceptible  world  around  them,  a  world  they
have to feel their way around in, like blind people among
visible objects. Clearly recognizing these higher regions
of existence and penetrating what goes on in them with
understanding is the only path that can really ground us
and  lead  us  toward  our  true  calling  as  human  beings.
Through insight into what is concealed from our senses,
we expand our own being in such a way that our life prior
to  this  expansion  seems  to  have  been  spent  dreaming
about the world.

[58]

VI. Thought Forms and the Human Aura

It has been said that the formations of any one of the three
worlds are real for us only if we have the faculties or or-
gans needed to perceive them. For example, certain pro-
cesses  taking  place  in  space  are  perceptible  to  us  as
manifestations  of  light  only  because  we  have  properly
formed eyes. How much of what is real actually becomes
evident to any being depends on that being’s degree of re-
ceptivity. We are never justified in saying that only what
we  ourselves  can  perceive  is  real.  Many  things  can  be
real, but we simply lack the organs to perceive them.

The soul and spirit worlds are just as real as the sense-
perceptible world; in fact, they are real in a much higher
sense. No physical eye can see feelings and concepts, but


they are real nonetheless. We encounter the phenomena of
the  physical  world  through  our  outer  senses;  similarly,
feelings, impulses, instincts, thoughts and so on become
perceptions for our spiritual organs. How these soul and
spiritual phenomena become perceptions by means of our
inner senses is analogous to how certain processes in space
are perceived as colors. Of course, the full meaning of this
statement can be understood only by those who have de-
veloped their inner senses by following the path to knowl-
edge  described  in  the  next  chapter.  To  such  people,  the
soul phenomena of the soul environment and the spiritual
phenomena of the spiritual region become supersensibly
visible. They experience another being’s feelings as raying
out toward them like rays of light; when they turn their at-
tention to others’ thoughts, these thoughts radiate through
spiritual space. For them, one person’s thought about an-
other person is not invisible, it is a perceptible process. The
actual content of a thought exists only in the mind of the
thinker, but it produces effects on the spiritual world and it
is this process that is perceptible to the spiritual eye. The
thought is an actual reality streaming out from one person
toward the other, and how it affects the other person is ex-
perienced as a perceptible process in the spiritual world.
For someone with opened spiritual senses, then, the phys-
ically perceptible person is only one part of the whole hu-
man being. The physical person is the center of soul and
spiritual streams.

It is impossible to do more here than merely hint at the
richly varied world that discloses itself to the seer. For
example, a thought that is otherwise alive only in the


listener’s understanding appears as a spiritually percepti-
ble  color  phenomenon,  its  color  corresponding  to  the
character of the thought. A thought stemming from a per-
son’s sensual impulses has a different tinge than one for-
mulated in the service of pure knowledge, noble beauty
or eternal truth. Thoughts springing from sensual activity
move  through  the  soul  world  in  shades  of  red,  while  a
thought  that  elevates  the  thinker  to  a  higher  form  of
knowledge appears in a beautiful shade of light yellow.
One that stems from loving devotion discloses itself in a
radiant rose-pink.11 The supersensible manifestation of a
thought expresses its degree of exactitude as well as its
content. A thinking mind’s precise thought appears as a
formation with distinct contours, while a confused idea
appears as a blurred and foggy formation.

In this way, a person’s soul and spirit nature appear as

[59]

the supersensible portion of a total human being.

These spiritually perceptible colors, which surround an
active  physical  human  being  like  an  egg-shaped  cloud,
constitute that person’s aura. The size of this aura varies
from person to person, but on the average we may imag-
ine a whole person to be about twice as tall and four times
as broad as his or her physical body.

Within  the  aura,  streams  of  different  colors  present  a
true and ever-changing picture of our inner life in all its
variability.  However,  there  are  also  some  lasting  basic

[60]

[61]

11. Because these descriptions are obviously open to the crassest mis-
interpretation, a brief further commentary on them has been added at
the end of this chapter.


[62]


colors  that  express  specific  permanent  traits—talents,
habits and idiosyncracies of character.

People who are currently far from being able to experi-
ence the path to knowledge described in the next chapter
are likely to misunderstand the nature of what is described
here as the “aura.” They may imagine that the colors de-
scribed here are present to our mind’s eye in the same way
that physical colors are present to our physical eyes. Such
“soul  colors,”  however,  would  be  mere  hallucinations.
Spiritual science has absolutely nothing to do with hallu-
cinatory impressions, and in any case that is not what is
meant by these descriptions. We can get the right idea of
what is meant if we keep in mind that we not only expe-
rience a sensory impression of a physical color, but also
have a soul experience that is different when our souls—
by means of our eyes—perceive a yellow surface than it
is when we perceive a blue one. Let us call this experience
“dwelling in yellow” or “dwelling in blue.” A soul that
has set out on the path to knowledge has this same expe-
rience of “dwelling in yellow” when it encounters the ac-
tive soul experiences of other beings, and of “dwelling in
blue” when it meets devotional attitudes. The point is not
that seers visualizing another soul see “blue” in the same
way they see it in the physical world, but rather that they
have an experience that justifies their calling the visual-
ization “blue,” just as people who are perceiving physi-
cally call a blue curtain “blue,” for example. Furthermore,
seers  must  be  aware  that  this  is  being  experienced  in  a
body-free  state,  so  that  they  acquire  the  possibility  of
speaking  about  the  value  and  significance  of  the  soul’s


[63]

[64]


life in a world not perceived through the medium of the
human  body.  The  sense  in  which  this  description  is  in-
tended must be kept in mind, even though seers talk as a
matter of course about “blue,” “yellow” or “green” in an
aura.

Human auras differ greatly according to individual dif-
ferences in temperament, personality and degree of spiri-
tual development. A person totally given over to animal
impulses  has  a  very  different  aura  than  someone  who
spends a lot of time thinking; a religious person’s aura is
fundamentally different from that of someone who is to-
tally caught up in trivial daily events. In addition, all of a
person’s  changing  moods,  inclinations,  pleasures  and
pains are expressed in his or her aura.

To learn what different shades of color in the aura sig-
nify, we must compare the auras of different types of men-
tal and emotional experiences. We will first look at inner
experiences  that  are  penetrated  through  and  through  by
pronounced emotions. These experiences can be separated
into two different types. In one type, the soul is driven to
these emotions primarily through the person’s animal na-
ture;  in  the  other  type,  emotions  assume  a  more  refined
form because they are strongly influenced by thinking and
deliberation, so to speak. In the first type of experience,
the streams of color flowing through particular parts of the
aura  are  primarily  various  shades  of  brown  and  reddish
yellow. In people with more refined emotions, shades of
lighter reddish yellow, and also green, appear in the same
places. It can be noted that shades of green appear more
frequently  with  increasing  intelligence.  People  who  are


[65]

[66]


highly intelligent but devote themselves totally to satisfy-
ing their animal impulses have a lot of green in their aura,
but this green always has a more or less pronounced tinge
of brown or brownish red. A large part of the aura of un-
intelligent people is flooded with streams that are brown-
ish red or even dark blood-red.

The auras of emotional states such as these are funda-
mentally  different  from  those  of  calm,  contemplative,
thoughtful  moods.  There  fewer  brownish  and  reddish
tones  are  present,  and  various  shades  of  green  become
more pronounced. During strenuous thinking, the aura’s
basic color becomes a pleasing green. This is especially
prominent in personalities who are said to be able to ad-
just to practically any situation in life.

Shades of blue appear during moods of devotion. The
more people place themselves in the service of a cause,
the more pronounced these shades of blue become. In this
connection,  too,  we  may  encounter  two  very  different
types of people. The first type consists of passive people
who are not used to exerting their powers of thought, who
have  only  their  good  nature  to  throw  into  the  flow  of
world  events,  so  to  speak.  Their  auras  glimmer  with  a
beautiful blue. This is also how many devotedly religious
personalities  appear,  as  do  compassionate  natures  and
people who devote themselves to leading a life of benev-
olence. If such people are also intelligent, blue streams al-
ternate with green, or the blue itself takes on a greenish
cast. In contrast to more passive personalities, more ac-
tive people typically have their blue suffused from within
with light, bright tones. This is most clearly the case in


personalities we would call “wise” and especially in those
who are full of fruitful ideas. In addition, everything that
points to intellectual or spiritual activity generally takes
the form of rays spreading out from within, while every-
thing originating in animal vitality assumes the form of ir-
regular clouds rolling through the aura.

According  to  whether  the  ideas  that  result  from  our
emotional or mental activity serve our personal animal-
istic impulses or ideal and objective interests, the color-
ing of the corresponding auric formations will differ. An
inventive mind that applies all its thoughts to satisfying
its own sensuous passions shows dark shades of blue and
red, while one that selflessly places its ideas at the ser-
vice of an objective interest shows light red-blue tones.
A life in the spirit that combines with noble devotion and
capacity for self-sacrifice shows rosy pink or light violet
colors.

However,  not  only  our  underlying  attitudes,  but  also
our  transient  emotions,  moods  and  other  inner  experi-
ences are present as floods of color in our auras. A sudden
outbreak of violent anger produces floods of red; a sud-
den upwelling of offended dignity appears as dark green
clouds. And these color phenomena appear not only in ir-
regular cloudlike formations, but also in figures of regu-
lar  form  and  distinct  limits.  In  the  aura  of  a  person
suddenly seized with fear, we notice wavy stripes of blue
with a reddish-blue shimmer moving from top to bottom.
The aura of someone who is tensely awaiting some par-
ticular  event  has  red-blue  stripes  constantly  radiating
from inside outward.

[67]

[68]


[69]

[70]


Someone  capable  of  precise  spiritual  perception  can
distinguish each impression another person receives from
outside. People who get excited about every external im-
pression have a constant flickering of little blue and red
spots and flecks in their auras, while people who perceive
less vividly have similar flecks that are yellow-orange or
a  lovely  yellow  color.  The  auras  of  so-called  “absent-
minded” people have bluish or blue-green specks of more
or less variable shape.

Within the auric streams and rays surrounding a per-
son, three different types of color phenomena are distin-
guishable to the more highly developed “spiritual eye.”
The first type of color is relatively dull and opaque in
character, although even it seems fleeting and transpar-
ent in comparison to the type of color seen by our phys-
ical  eyes.  Within  the  spiritual  world  itself,  however,
these colors make the space they occupy comparatively
opaque,  as  if  they  were  filling  it  with  figures  of  mist.
The second type of color is all light, so to speak; these
colors light up the space they occupy so that it too be-
comes all light. But the third type of color phenomenon
is  totally  different  from  the  other  two  in  its  radiating,
sparkling, glittering character. These colors do not sim-
ply  fill  the  space  they  light  up;  they  shine  and  radiate
right through it. There is something active and inwardly
mobile about them, as if they were constantly creating
themselves  from  within,  while  the  other  colors  have
something quieter and more lackluster about them. Fig-
uratively speaking, the first two types of color fill space
with  a  delicate  fluid  that  quietly  stays  put,  while  the


third type fills it with constantly self-enkindling life and
unceasing activity.

These three color types are not arranged in distinct lay-
ers in the human aura, nor do they occupy separate areas
of space. Instead, they interpenetrate in a great variety of
ways. It is possible to watch all three kinds mixing and
mingling in the same place in the aura, just as a physical
object  such  as  a  bell  can  be  both  seen  and  heard  at  the
same time. This means that the aura is actually an incred-
ibly complex phenomenon, because we are actually deal-
ing  with  three  interpenetrating  auras.  However,  we  can
sort things out by turning our supersensible attention to
only one of the three at a time. This is similar to shutting
our eyes while listening intently to a piece of music in the
sense-perceptible  world.  Seers  have  three  different  or-
gans for the three kinds of color, so to speak, and can open
one of them to impressions while closing the other two for
the sake of undisturbed observation. To begin with, some
seers may be able to see only one aura while the others re-
main invisible; others are receptive to the first two types
but not to the third. The ability to observe all three auras,
and to direct one’s attention to one at a time for purposes
of study, constitutes the higher stage of seership.

The threefold human aura is the supersensibly percep-
tible expression of the three components of the human
being’s essential nature—body, soul and spirit. [73] The
first aura reflects the body’s influence on the soul; the
second  represents  the  soul’s  own  life  that  extends  be-
yond direct sensory stimulation but is not yet devoted to
the service of the eternal; the third reflects the immortal

[71]

[72]


[74]


spirit’s degree of mastery over the transitory aspect of hu-
man nature. It must be emphasized at this point that since
these things are even more difficult to describe than they
are to observe, this and any other attempt to describe au-
ras should never be taken as anything more than a stim-
ulus to understanding.

Thus, to a seer, the idiosyncracies of an individual’s in-
ner life are expressed in that person’s auric makeup. Any
emotional or mental activity that is totally given over to
sensuous impulses, fleeting desires and momentary exter-
nal  stimuli  shows  up  as  garish  colors  in  the  first  aura,
while  the  second  is  weakly  developed,  showing  mere
traces of colored forms. In a case like this the third aura is
barely visible. Only a flicker of color here and there indi-
cates that even in a person with this attitude, the eternal is
present in the form of potentials even though it may be
suppressed by the effect of sensory factors. The more a
person  rids  him-  or  herself  of  physical  urges,  the  less
prominent the first part of the aura becomes. Meanwhile,
the  second  part  becomes  larger  and  larger,  filling  the
body  of  colors  within  which  the  physical  human  being
dwells with its radiating energy. And the more a person
proves to be a servant of the eternal, the more the third
part of the aura is revealed, showing the extent to which
that individual is a citizen of the spiritual world. Through
this part of the aura, an individual’s divine self radiates
into the earthly world. To the extent that individuals give
evidence of this aura, they are flames used by the divinity
to enlighten this world; through this part of the aura, they
show the extent to which they work out of the eternally


[76]


true,  beautiful  and  good,  rather  than  out  of  themselves,
the extent to which they have wrested from their narrower
selves the capacity to offer themselves up on the great al-
tar of cosmic activity. [75] Thus what individuals have
made  of  themselves  in  the  course  of  their  incarnations
comes to expression in their auras.

All  three  parts  of  the  aura  contain  many  different
shades of colors whose quality changes with an individu-
al’s degree of development. In the first portion, a person’s
undeveloped life of urges and impulses is seen in shades
that  range  from  red  to  blue.  These  shades  are  dull  and
opaque in quality. Pronounced shades of red point to sen-
sual desires, lust and the pleasures of the palate. Shades of
green appear primarily in characters with a tendency to
apathy  and  indifference,  lower  natures  who  give  them-
selves up greedily to any pleasures that come along but
avoid  the  personal  effort  it  would  take  to  satisfy  them.
When a person’s passions are intent on some goal beyond
the reach of his or her acquired abilities, brownish green
and yellowish green tints appear in the aura. This type of
aura  is  fostered  by  certain  modern  lifestyles. [77]  The
lowest  level  of  egotism—personal  vanity  rooted  in  low
inclinations—is  revealed  in  muddy  yellow  to  brown
tones.

But of course a life of animalistic urges also has a pos-
itive side. Even within the animal kingdom, a pure and
natural  capacity  for  self-sacrifice,  of  which  instinctive
mother-love is the most beautiful and highest expression,
is evident to a great extent. Such selfless natural urges are
expressed in the first aura in shades of light red to rose,


[78]

[79]


while cowardly trepidation and a timid response to sen-
sory stimuli show up as blue with a brownish or grayish
cast.

Various grades of color are also apparent in the second
aura.  Brown  and  orange  forms  express  strongly  devel-
oped  vanity,  pride  and  ambition;  red  and  yellow  flecks
point to curiosity. Green expresses an understanding of
life and the world, while pale green reflects clear thinking
and intelligence. Children who learn easily have a lot of
green in this part of their auras. A greenish yellow color-
ing  in  the  second  aura  points  to  a  good  memory.  Rose
pink indicates loving and benevolent wisdom, while blue
is  a  sign  of  piety,  verging  on  violet  as  this  piety  ap-
proaches  religious  fervor.  Idealism  and  a  serious,  ele-
vated outlook on life are seen as indigo blue.

In the third aura, the primary colors are yellow, green
and  blue.  Here,  light  yellow  appears  when  thinking  is
filled with elevated and comprehensive ideas that grasp
the place of details in the divine order of the universe. In
the case of intuitive thinking that has been purified of all
sensory  images,  the  yellow  acquires  a  golden  glow.
Green  expresses  love  for  all  beings;  blue  is  the  sign  of
willingness to make sacrifices for the sake of all. If this
capacity for sacrifice intensifies into a forceful will that
places itself actively in the service of the world, the blue
becomes  a  light  violet.  If  pride  and  ambition  are  still
present as remnants of personal egotism in an otherwise
highly developed soul, shades verging on orange appear
in addition to the yellow. It is important to note, however,
that the colors in this part of the aura are very different


from the shades we are used to seeing in the sense-per-
ceptible  world.  The  beauty  and  sublimity  that  meet  us
here  cannot  be  compared  to  anything  in  the  ordinary
world.

This  description  of  the  aura  cannot  be  properly  as-
sessed by anyone who does not place primary importance
on the fact that “seeing auras” signifies an expansion and
enrichment of our perception in the physical world. The
intent  of  this  expanded  perception  is  to  recognize  that
form of soul life which possesses spiritual reality outside
of the sense-perceptible world. What has been presented
here has nothing to do with reading a person’s thoughts
or character from a hallucinatory aura and wants no deal-
ings with this questionable art. Its intent is to expand our
understanding in the direction of the spiritual world.

A D D E N D U M

Of all the chapters in this book, this one on “Thought Forms and
the Human Aura” is probably the one most open to misinterpreta-
tion by opinions to the contrary, the one to which the most objec-
tions can be raised. For instance, it would be quite understandable
to insist that a seer’s statements in this field be proved by experi-
ments in line with scientific thinking, such as having a number of
people who claim to be able to see spiritual auras stand face to face
with  a  number  of  subjects  whose  auras  they  allow  to  work  on
them. These seers should then report what thoughts, feelings, and
so on they saw in the auras of the people they observed. If their re-
ports agree, and if it turns out that their subjects really did have the
feelings and thoughts ascribed to them, belief in the existence of
auras would seem reasonable. This is certainly the scientific way


to look at the issue. But something else must be taken into consid-
eration. Spiritual researchers’ work on their own souls gives them
the capacity for spiritual vision; that is the point of their efforts.
But whether they are then able to perceive something in the spiri-
tual world in any given instance, and exactly what they perceive,
does not depend on them but comes to meet them as a gift from
the spiritual world. They cannot force it, they have to wait until it
comes. Their intent to perceive spiritually is never the real cause
of it happening, although that is what science would assume in the
case of this experiment. The spiritual world will not allow itself to
be bossed around. If this experiment were to come about at all, it
would have to be initiated by the spiritual world, by a spiritual be-
ing’s intention to reveal the thoughts of one or more subjects to
one or more seers. A spiritual impulse would have to bring these
seers together to carry out the observation, in which case their re-
ports would be sure to agree. As paradoxical as it may seem to a
strictly scientific mind, this is the fact of the matter. Spiritual ex-
periments cannot come about in the same way as physical ones. If
clairvoyants are visited by people they do not know, it cannot sim-
ply be assumed that they will be able to see the strangers’ auras; it
is not a matter of deliberate intent. They will be able to see them
if and when there is a reason for it in the spiritual world.

The point of these few words is to draw attention to the miscon-
ception  inherent  in  the  objection  described  above.  Spiritual  sci-
ence  is  meant  to  describe  how  people  can  learn  to  see  and
experience  the  reality  of  auras  for  themselves;  all  it  can  say  to
those who seek this knowledge is, “Apply these prerequisites to
yourselves, and you too will see.” It would certainly be more ex-
pedient  if  the  demands  of  scientific  thinking  could  be  met,  but
those who require proofs of this sort have not familiarized them-
selves with even the most elementary results of spiritual science.
This book’s statements about the human aura are not intended
to accommodate spiritual sensation seekers who will be satisfied


only  by  being  presented  with  something  “spiritual”  that  can  be
conceived  of  no  differently  than  something  physical—that  is,
when  they  can  rest  content  in  the  sense  world  with  their  usual
ideas. What was said at the beginning of this chapter about how
auric color is to be imagined was surely calculated to prevent mis-
understandings  of  this  sort.  But  anyone  who  aspires  to  genuine
spiritual insight has to realize that direct experience of matters of
spirit and soul involves seeing the aura spiritually rather than sen-
sorily.  Without  spiritual  perception,  the  experience  remains  un-
conscious.  We  must  not  confuse  the  experience  itself  with  its
expression in pictorial form, but we must realize that the experi-
ence is very adequately expressed in this pictorial view. It is not
something the perceiving soul makes up arbitrarily; it takes shape
of itself in supersensible perception.

Scientists may be forgiven if they find themselves compelled to
describe a human aura of some sort, as Dr. Moritz Benedikt does
in his book on the rod and pendulum theory:

There are a small number of people who are adapted to see-
ing in the dark. Of this minority, a relatively large percentage
can see many objects in darkness but without colors, and only
relatively few also see in colors. . . . My two classic cases of
seeing in the dark examined a considerable number of schol-
ars  and  physicians. . .in  my  darkroom,  and  these  subjects
were left with no justifiable doubt as to the accuracy of their
observations and descriptions. . . . People who see colors  in
the dark see the front of the forehead and scalp as well as the
rest of the righthand side in blue, while the left side is seen as
red or sometimes. . .yellow and orange. The division and col-
oring are the same when seen from behind.*

*Moritz  Benedikt,  1835-1920,  physician.  His  book Ruten  und  Pendellehre  (The
Rod  and  Pendulum  Theory)  was  published  in  Vienna  in  1917;  this  quotation  is
from page 17.


Spiritual scientists, however, will not be forgiven so easily if

they talk about auras.

But this author’s intention is neither to take any kind of position
on Benedikt’s report—which is one of the most interesting in the
annals of modern science—nor to grab at any flimsy opportunity
to justify spiritual science by means of the natural sciences. His in-
tent is only to point out how in one case someone investigating
natural phenomena can make claims that are not totally dissimilar
to those of spiritual science. It should be emphasized, however,
that the aura discussed in this book is to be grasped by spiritual
means and is something completely different from the one Bene-
dikt is talking about, which can be studied by physical means. We
would be surrendering to a gross illusion if we were to believe that
spiritual auras could be investigated by any outer scientific meth-
ods. They are only accessible to the spiritual vision acquired on
the path to knowledge described in the last chapter of this book.
To recapitulate, the idea that the truth of spiritual perception can
be verified in the same way that the truth of physical perception
can, is based on a total misunderstanding.

## CHAPTER 4

### THE PATH TO KNOWLEDGE

[1]

Each one of us is capable of coming to understand spiri-
tual science as it is presented in this book. Explanations
such as those given here provide an image of the higher
worlds in thought form. In a certain respect, since we hu-
man beings are thinking beings, these very explanations
constitute a first step toward perceiving for ourselves. We
can only find our own path to knowledge by taking think-
ing itself as our starting point. To present our understand-
ing  with  an  image  of  higher  worlds  is  by  no  means
fruitless,  although  at  the  immediate  moment  it  may  in-
deed be no more than an account of things we are not yet
able to perceive for ourselves. Thoughts that have been
supplied for us constitute a force that goes on working in
the  world  of  our  thoughts.  This  force  becomes  active
within us, arousing potentials that lie dormant in us. It is
a mistake to believe that we waste our time by dwelling
on an image in thought form. This opinion assumes that
thoughts are unreal and abstract, while in actuality they


are founded on a living force. To someone who has ac-
quired  knowledge,  thoughts  are  present  as  a  direct  ex-
pression of what is perceived in the spirit, and when this
expression is communicated to a second person, it lives
on in that person as a seed that will grow and bear knowl-
edge as its fruit. Anyone who scorns strenuous mental ef-
fort  as  a  way  of  acquiring  higher  knowledge,  turning
instead to other forces available to us, is not taking into
account the fact that thinking is the highest of the facul-
ties we human beings possess in the physical world.

For  this  reason,  people  who  ask  how  to  acquire  direct
higher spiritual scientific knowledge should be told to be-
gin by familiarizing themselves with what others have to
say about it. If they insist that they want only to see for
themselves, that they do not want to know about what other
people have seen, they must be told that learning what oth-
ers have to say on the subject is the first step toward acquir-
ing knowledge for themselves. Of course they may say that
meanwhile they are forced to accept things on blind faith.
However, the point is not to believe or disbelieve what has
been communicated, but only to be unbiased and receptive
toward it. Genuine spiritual researchers never speak in the
expectation that they will be met with blind faith, but say
only, “These are my experiences in spiritual areas of exist-
ence, and I am simply telling you about them.” However,
they also know that opening oneself to this information and
imbuing one’s own thoughts with it constitute active forces
for spiritual development in the listener.

[2]

To approach this issue correctly, we must take into ac-
count  that  all  knowledge  of  the  soul  and  spirit  worlds


lies dormant in each human soul and can be brought to
light by traveling the path to knowledge. However, we
are capable of grasping not only what we ourselves bring
up from the soul’s depths, but also what someone else
has done in this respect. This is true even if we ourselves
have not set out on the path to knowledge. Correct spir-
itual insight awakens the power of understanding in any
mind  not  clouded  by  prejudice,  and  our  own  subcon-
scious  knowledge  readily  acknowledges  spiritual  facts
discovered by others. This is no blind faith, but rather the
natural  response  of  common  sense.  What  our  healthy
natural understanding recognizes as true when presented
with the results of genuine spiritual research constitutes
a much better starting point for firsthand knowledge of
the  spiritual  world  than  any  dubious  mystical  contem-
plations and the like, even though we often assume the
opposite.

The need to subject ourselves to the hard work of think-
ing if we want to develop our capacity for higher knowl-
edge cannot be emphasized strongly enough. This is all
the more urgent because many people who want to be-
come  seers  underestimate  the  need  for  this  earnest  and
self-denying work on one’s thinking. They say that think-
ing  doesn’t  work  for  them,  that  everything  depends  on
“feeling,” or the like. These people must be told that it is
impossible to become a seer in the true higher sense of the
word without first working one’s way into the world of
thinking. A certain inner laziness plays a regrettable role
in many personalities, who do not become aware of it be-
cause it disguises itself as contempt for abstract thinking

[3]


and for idle speculation, and so on. However, we com-
pletely misunderstand thinking if we confuse it with any
idle or abstract spinning of thoughts. That kind of “ab-
stract thinking” can easily kill supersensible knowledge,
but living, vital thinking can become the foundation for
it.

Of  course  it  would  be  much  more  comfortable  if  we
could avoid the strenuous work of thinking while acquir-
ing the higher faculties of a seer, and many people would
prefer to do it that way. However, only thinking can lead
to the inner steadiness and stability of soul that seership re-
quires. Without it, we get nothing more than a meaning-
less  and  erratic  display  of  images—enjoyable,  perhaps,
but totally irrelevant as far as actual access to the higher
world is concerned. And if we consider the purely spiritual
experiences of an individual who really enters the higher
world, we will also grasp still another side of the issue. An
absolutely healthy soul life is essential for a seer, and there
is no better means of cultivating a healthy soul life than
real thinking. In fact, people’s mental health can suffer se-
riously  if  their  training  for  higher  development  is  not
based on thinking. Becoming a seer will make any healthy
right-thinking individual even healthier and more fit for
life than before, but taking a dreamy approach to self-de-
velopment  by  shunning  the  rigors  of  thinking  can  only
foster illusions and a faulty approach to life. There is no
need to worry, however, as long as what has been said here
is taken into account as a prerequisite to higher develop-
ment, a prerequisite that has to do exclusively with the hu-
man soul and spirit. Once this prerequisite is recognized,


[4]

[5]


to  talk  about  any  possible  harmful  effect  on  a  person’s
bodily health is absurd.

Unwarranted disbelief, however, is harmful because it
acts  as  a  repelling  force,  preventing  the  recipient  from
taking up the fruitful influence of these thoughts. The pre-
requisite to opening our higher senses is not blind faith,
but simply receptivity to the world of spiritual scientific
thought.  Spiritual  researchers  challenge  their  students,
not to believe what they are told, but to think it, to take it
into  the  world  of  their  own  thoughts.  By  allowing  it  to
work from within, they will come to recognize its truth on
their  own.  This  is  the  approach  spiritual  researchers
take—they  provide  the  incentive,  but  the  power  to  per-
ceive the truth arises within the listeners themselves. This
is how spiritual scientific ideas ought to be sought. Those
who have the self-discipline to immerse their thoughts in
spiritual science can be sure that this will eventually lead
to the ability to perceive for themselves.

What has just been said already suggests one of the first
qualities  that  must  be  cultivated  by  people  who  want  to
achieve independent perception of higher realities. It is un-
reserved and unbiased devotion to what human life or the
world outside us has to reveal. If we approach any phe-
nomenon with a preconceived notion derived from our life
as it has been until now, we shut ourselves off from the
quiet yet pervasive influence this phenomenon can have
on us. While learning, we must be able at any moment to
make ourselves into a totally empty vessel into which the
world we do not know can flow. Moments of recognition
happen only when any prejudice or criticism coming from


us is silenced. For instance, it makes no difference whether
we are wiser than the person we are meeting—even a child
with minimal understanding has something to disclose to
the greatest sage. Approaching the child with any prejudg-
ment at all, no matter how wise, is like looking “through a
glass, darkly” at what the child has to reveal.1

Complete inner selflessness is part of this devotion to
what the unknown world can reveal, and we will proba-
bly make some astonishing discoveries about ourselves
when we test the extent of our own devotion. If we want
to set out on the path to higher knowledge, we must prac-
tice until we are able to obliterate ourselves and all our
prejudices  at  any  moment  so  that  something  else  can
flow into us. Only high levels of selfless devotion enable
us to perceive the higher spiritual phenomena all around
us. We can deliberately cultivate this faculty by trying to
refrain from judging people in our surroundings, for ex-
ample.  We  must  eliminate  any  standards  of  attractive-
ness and unattractiveness, stupidity and cleverness, that
we apply as a matter of habit. We must try to understand
people purely out of themselves. It is best to practice on
people  to  whom  we  have  an  active  aversion,  forcibly
suppressing this aversion and letting everything they do
work on us without bias. Or if we find ourselves in some
circumstances that elicit a certain judgment in response,
we can suppress this judgment in order to be receptive

erasing our own judgment or submitting to blind faith—this would
make no sense in reference to a child.


and unbiased toward any impressions that may come to
us.2

We should allow things and events to speak to us more
than  we  speak  about  them,  and  we  should  extend  this
principle to our thoughts as well, suppressing whatever it
is in ourselves that shapes a certain thought and allowing
only external things to elicit thoughts. Exercises like this
can help us achieve our goal of higher knowledge only if
they are carried out with persistence and in holy earnest-
ness. Anyone who underestimates exercises of this sort is
totally unaware of their value. On the other hand, anyone
experienced in these matters knows that devotion and ab-
sence of bias actually create strength. Just as the heat that
is  applied  to  a  boiler  is  transformed  into  the  force  that
makes  a  steam  engine  move,  these  exercises  in  selfless
spiritual  devotion  are  transformed  within  us  into  the
strength to see into the spiritual worlds.

By means of this exercise, we make ourselves receptive
to  everything  around  us,  but  receptivity  is  not  enough.
We must also be capable of properly assessing what we
perceive. As long as we still tend to overvalue ourselves
at the expense of the world around us, we are putting off
the moment when we will gain access to higher knowl-
edge. People who give in to the personal pleasure or pain
they  experience  through  things  and  events  in  the  outer

2.  This unbiased receptivity has nothing to do with blind faith. The
point  is  not  to  believe  blindly  in  something,  but  rather  to  refrain
from letting “blind judgment” usurp the place of a living and vital
impression.

world  are  still  caught  up  in  valuing  themselves  too
highly.  Their  personal  pleasure  or  pain  teaches  them
something about themselves but nothing about the things
in  question.  If  I  am  sympathetically  inclined  toward
someone, my own relationship to that person is all I can
experience at first. And if I allow my judgment and my
behavior  to  depend  on  my  own  feelings  of  pleasure  or
sympathy, I allow my own idiosyncracies to take center
stage and impose them on my surroundings. I want the
world to include me just as I am, but I do not want to
accept the world for what it is or to let it assert itself in
accordance with the forces at work in it. In other words,
I  am  tolerant  of  only  what  suits  my  own  personality;  I
ward off anything else. And as long as we remain cap-
tives of the sense world, we are especially likely to ward
off any non-sensory influences.

As  we  learn,  we  must  develop  the  ability  to  relate  to
things  and  people  in  their  uniqueness,  recognizing  the
value and significance of each and every one. Sympathy
and antipathy, pleasure and displeasure, must take on to-
tally new roles. This is clearly not a matter of completely
eradicating sympathy and antipathy and becoming totally
numb to them. On the contrary, the more we cultivate our
ability to refrain from responding immediately to sympa-
thy or antipathy with a judgment or an action, the finer the
sensitivity we develop. Once we can control the character
they  already  assume  within  us,  we  will  experience  that
sympathies  and  antipathies  assume  a  higher  character.
Even the seemingly most unappealing thing has hidden
qualities that are revealed when we do not simply yield to


[7]


our own selfish feelings. People who have schooled them-
selves in this regard are exceptionally sensitive to every-
thing around them because they do not allow their own
inclinations  to  make  them  unreceptive.  Any  inclination
we follow blindly deadens our ability to see things around
us in the right light; it makes us force our way through our
environment rather than exposing ourselves to it and ex-
periencing its inherent value.

Once we no longer react selfishly to each instance of joy
and  pain,  sympathy  and  antipathy,  we  become  indepen-
dent  of  the  changing  impressions  we  receive  from  the
outer world. The pleasure we experience because of a par-
ticular  thing  immediately  makes  us  dependent  on  that
thing; we lose ourselves in it. We cannot travel the path to
higher knowledge if we are constantly losing ourselves in
either pleasure or pain as a result of the ever-changing im-
pressions that confront us. Once we have learned to accept
pleasure  and  pain  with  equanimity,  we  can  stop  losing
ourselves in them and begin to understand them. As soon
as I surrender to pleasure, it consumes my very existence.
Instead, I should make use of pleasure only as a means of
understanding pleasurable things. The point for me should
not be the fact that something causes me pleasure; I should
experience the pleasure and, through it, the nature of the
thing itself. For me, pleasure should be nothing more than
an indication that this thing possesses the ability to give
pleasure, a characteristic I must learn to recognize in it. If
I stop short at the pleasure itself and let myself be totally
taken in by it, I am experiencing only myself; on the other
hand, if pleasure gives me an opportunity to experience a


characteristic of the thing itself, I enrich my inner nature
through  the  experience.  In  the  course  of  our  research,
pleasure  and  displeasure,  joy  and  pain,  must  present  us
with  opportunities  to  learn  about  things.  This  does  not
make us immune to pleasure and pain; it enables us to rise
above them so that they can disclose the actual nature of
external things. By cultivating this faculty, we will come
to realize what good teachers pleasure and pain are. We
will co-experience what each and every being feels and
thus receive a revelation of its inner nature.

If we are truly seeking, we never stop short at our own
suffering or pleasure, but always ask what that joy or suf-
fering has to tell us. We surrender our personal selves so
that suffering or pleasure coming from the outside world
can work on us. This permits us to develop a totally new
way of relating to things. Whereas our reactions to spe-
cific impressions used to be based only on our own liking
or disliking, we can now let pleasure and displeasure be
organs through which things tell us what they themselves
are  in  their  essence.  In  us,  pleasure  and  pain  are  trans-
formed from mere feelings into sensory organs through
which we perceive the outer world. When our eyes see
something, they do not take action themselves but rather
cause our hands to act. So, too, when a spiritual research-
er’s pleasure and pain (to the extent that they are being
applied  as  a  means  to  knowledge)  receive  impressions,
they  do  not  act  directly;  only  what  is  experienced  via
pleasure and displeasure then leads to action. When we
make a practice of using pleasure and displeasure as or-
gans to transmit information, they fashion the actual soul


[8]


organs we need for the soul world to disclose itself to us.
Our eyes can serve our physical body only by being or-
gans of transmission for sensory impressions; similarly,
pleasure and displeasure develop into “soul eyes” when
they cease to assert themselves for their own sake and be-
gin to reveal unknown souls to us.

The above-mentioned faculties put us in a position to
let the things and beings present in our surroundings work
on us free of the disturbing influence from our own idio-
syncrasies.  But  we  must  also  insert  ourselves  into  the
spiritual world, of which we all, as thinking beings, are
citizens. This can happen in the right way only if, during
the  process  of  recognizing  the  spirit,  we  can  make  our
train of thought correspond to the eternal laws of truth, the
laws of spirit country. This is the only way this world can
work on us and reveal its phenomena to us.

We will not reach the truth by simply giving ourselves
up  to  the  transient  thoughts  coursing  through  our  “I.”
These thoughts have their progression imposed on them
in that they come into existence within our bodily nature.
As long as the physical brain is conditioning our cognitive
activity, our thoughts appear haphazard and confused—
one thought begins and then breaks off, driven from the
scene by a second thought. If we really examine a conver-
sation between two people as we listen to it, or if we ob-
serve ourselves carefully, we will get an idea of the will-
o’-the-wisp quality of these thoughts. As long as we are
applying  ourselves  to  tasks  in  the  sense-perceptible
world, our confused train of thought is always straight-
ened out by the actual matter at hand. Regardless of how


confused I am in my thinking, daily life forces me to con-
form to the laws of reality in my actions. For example, I
may have an extremely haphazard idea of how a city is
laid out, but if I want to get around in it, I have to adapt to
how things really are. Mechanics may come into the shop
with their heads full of a jumble of all kinds of ideas, but
the laws governing how their machines work will compel
them  to  adopt  appropriate  working  procedures.  In  the
sense-perceptible world, hard facts act as a constant cor-
rective  to  our  thinking.  If  I  have  the  wrong  idea  about
some physical phenomenon such as the form of a plant,
reality confronts me and sets my thinking straight.

In relationship to higher areas of existence, however,
things  are  very  different.  These  realms  disclose  them-
selves to me only when I approach them with my think-
ing  already  strictly  disciplined.  In  this  case,  if  my
thinking does not provide the correct impulse, if I am not
my own confident guide, I will not find the right way to
go.  The  spiritual  laws  prevailing  here  have  not  con-
densed to the point of physical perceptibility and there-
fore  do  not  impose  the  same  corrective  as  sense-
perceptible things do, so I will be able to obey them only
if they are related to my own laws, the ones that govern
me as a thinking being. As a seeker of knowledge, I must
alter my thinking so that it is strictly self-regulating. My
thoughts must gradually get out of the habit of running
their everyday course and adopt instead the inner charac-
ter of the spiritual world. I must be able to observe myself
in this regard and keep things under control. I must not
allow one thought to follow another arbitrarily but only


in accordance with the rigorous standards of the contents
of the thought world. The transition from one idea to an-
other  must  correspond  to  strict  laws  of  thinking,  and  I
myself as a thinker must stand as a copy of these laws, so
to speak. I must eliminate from my train of thought ev-
erything  not  flowing  from  these  laws.  If  a  favorite
thought gets in my way, I must push it aside so that it does
not disturb the orderly sequence, and if a personal feeling
tries to impose a direction on my thoughts that is not in-
herent in them, I must suppress it.

Plato  required  those  applying  to  his  school  to  take  a
course in mathematics first. Since the strict laws of math-
ematics are not subject to the ordinary course of sensory
phenomena, they make a very good preparation for seek-
ers of knowledge, who must put aside personal arbitrari-
ness  and  distractions  if  they  wish  to  make  progress  in
mathematics.  Voluntarily  overcoming  all  uncontrolled
and arbitrary thinking prepares them for the task ahead.
They learn to respond to only the requirements of think-
ing  itself,  since  that  is  how  they  must  proceed  in  all
thought  activity  that  serves  spiritual  knowledge.  Their
thinking must replicate the undisturbed results and con-
clusions  of  mathematics.  Wherever  they  go,  wherever
they may be, they must always attempt to think in this
way. Then the laws of the spiritual world, laws that pass
through without a trace when thinking is of the everyday
confused  variety,  can  flow  into  them.  Well-ordered
thinking  leads  them  from  secure  starting  points  to  the
most  hidden  truths.  (These  suggestions  should  not  be
taken  one-sidedly,  however—although  mathematics  is


[9]


good  practice  and  discipline  for  our  thinking,  it  is  cer-
tainly possible to learn pure, healthy and vital thinking
without it.)

Seekers  of  knowledge  must  have  the  same  goals  for
their actions as they have for their thinking—that is, their
actions  must  not  be  disrupted  by  their  personality,  but
must be able to obey the laws of eternal beauty and truth,
accepting  the  direction  these  laws  provide.  Knowledge
seekers  who  have  begun  something  they  recognize  as
right may not give up simply because what they are doing
is not emotionally satisfying. On the other hand, they may
not continue with something just because they enjoy it if
they discover that it does not conform to the laws of eter-
nal beauty and truth. In everyday life, people let their ac-
tions  be  determined  by  what  is  personally  satisfying  or
fruitful; they impose the direction of their own personal-
ity on the course of world events. They are doing nothing
to bring about the truth laid out in the laws of the spiritual
world; they are simply fulfilling their own arbitrary de-
mands. We are acting in harmony with the spiritual world
only when its laws are the only ones we obey. Actions
proceeding  only  from  our  own  personality  supply  no
forces that could form a basis for spiritual knowledge.

Seekers of knowledge cannot consider only what will
yield  fruit  or  lead  to  success  for  themselves;  they  must
also consider what they have recognized as good. They
must willingly submit to the strict law that requires them
to renounce all personal arbitrariness and all fruits their
actions may have for their own personality. Then they are
walking the paths of the spiritual world and their whole


being is permeated by its laws. They are freed from all
sensory constraints; their spirit being lifts free of its sen-
sory trappings. This is how they spiritualize themselves,
how they make progress toward the spiritual.

We cannot question whether it does any good to resolve
to obey only the laws of truth when in fact we may be mis-
taken about what is true. Everything depends on our effort
and our attitude, and even people who are mistaken but
are  aspiring  to  the  truth  possess  a  strength  that  will  set
them back on the right track. The very objection that we
may be mistaken is in itself destructive disbelief and dem-
onstrates a lack of trust in the power of truth. The point
here is that instead of presuming to decide on our goals
from our own self-serving point of view, we should sub-
mit selflessly to the spirit and allow it to determine our di-
rection for us. Self-serving human volition cannot dictate
to the truth. Truth itself must become sovereign in us, fill-
ing our whole being and transforming us into a replica of
spirit  country’s  eternal  laws.  We  must  imbue  ourselves
with these eternal laws in order to let them flow out into
life. As seekers of knowledge, we must have our will as
well as our thinking strictly under control. Then, in all hu-
mility and without presumption, we become messengers
of the world of truth and beauty. We advance to become
participants in the spiritual world and are lifted from one
level of development to the next. But we cannot achieve
living in the spirit merely by being beholders of it—it has
to be experienced.

If  the  laws  that  are  presented  here  are  observed  by
seekers of knowledge, their  inner  experience in relation

[10]


to  the  spiritual  world  will  assume  a  completely  new
form. Instead of having significance only for their own
personal life, it will develop into soul perceptions of the
higher world. Feelings of pleasure and displeasure or joy
and pain will grow into soul organs that transmit outer
impressions selflessly like physical eyes and ears, which
also  do  not  exist  for  themselves  alone.  This  is  how
knowledge seekers achieve the calm and secure frame of
mind required for research in the spiritual world. A great
pleasure that once would have simply made them jump
for joy will now alert them to previously unnoticed as-
pects of their surroundings and will leave them at peace.
Within  this  peace,  features  of  the  entities  causing  the
pleasure will be revealed. And on the other hand, pain
will no longer simply fill the seekers with distress but
will also be able to inform them what qualities belong to
the being causing the pain. Like eyes, which desire noth-
ing for themselves but selflessly show the physical per-
son what direction to take, pleasure and pain will lead
the soul safely on its way.

This is the state of inner equanimity that we as seekers
of knowledge must achieve. When pleasure and pain no
longer  expend  themselves  in  creating  turbulence  in  our
inner life, they begin to function like eyes open to the su-
persensible world. It is not possible to use pleasure and
pain as sources of information as long as we are dwelling
in and on them, but once we have learned to live through
them and no longer relate our feeling of identity to them,
they become organs of perception we can use in order to
see and to know. It is incorrect to think that a sage must


[11]


become  a  dry,  sober  person  incapable  of  experiencing
pleasure or pain. For such a person, pleasure and pain still
exist,  but  when  he  or  she  is  investigating  the  spiritual
world, these are present in metamorphosed form as “eyes
and ears.”

As long as our relationship to the world is a personal
one, things show us only what connects them to our own
personality.  This,  however,  is  merely  their  transient  as-
pect. If we pull back from what is transient in ourselves
and dwell with our “I” and our feeling of identity in what
is lasting in us, our transient features are transformed and
begin to convey the eternal aspects of things to us. This
relationship between our own eternal aspect and what is
eternal in other things is something seekers must be able
to bring about deliberately. Before taking up any other ex-
ercises of the sort described here, and also while practic-
ing them, we need to direct our attention to this immortal
aspect. Whenever I observe a stone, plant, animal or per-
son, I should be aware that something eternal is expressed
there. I should be able to wonder about what is lasting in
a transitory stone or a mortal person, what it is that will
outlast their transient sense-perceptible manifestation.

We must not imagine that if we turn our mind to the
eternal like this, it will estrange us from immediate reality
and destroy our ordinary capacity for observation and our
feeling for everyday affairs. On the contrary! Each little
leaf and beetle will reveal countless mysteries when we
look  at  it  not  only  with  our  eyes  but  also,  through  our
eyes, with our spirit as well. Every glimmer or shade of
color, every intonation, will remain vividly perceptible to


our senses. Nothing will be lost, but infinite new life will
be gained. People who do not know how to observe the
smallest  detail  with  their  eyes  will  also  never  achieve
spiritual vision, but only pale and bloodless thoughts. Ev-
erything depends on the attitude we acquire.

How far we get will depend on our abilities. We only
have to do what is right and let the rest develop on its
own. To begin with, we must be content with turning our
attention to what is lasting; this effort in and of itself will
eventually  allow  us  to  recognize  the  eternal.  We  must
wait until this is given to us. It will happen at the right
moment  if  we  wait—and work.  Soon  after  beginning
such  exercises,  people  notice  major  inner  transforma-
tions. They learn to base their estimation of a thing’s im-
portance  or  lack  of  it  exclusively  on  its  recognized
relationship  to  something  lasting  and  eternal.  They  ar-
rive at a new and different assessment of the world and
feel  differently  related  to  their  surroundings.  What  is
transitory no longer attracts them for its own sake, as it
used to, but becomes both part of and a metaphor for the
eternal. They learn to love the eternal that lives in every-
thing; it becomes as familiar to them as only the transi-
tory aspect was before. This does not estrange them from
life; on the contrary, they learn to value each thing in ac-
cordance with its true significance. Even life’s trivial as-
pects do not leave such people untouched, but instead of
getting lost in frivolities, spirit-seeking individuals see
them in the right light and recognize their limited value.
It would be a poor seeker of knowledge who would pre-
fer to roam the cloudy heights and lose touch with life.


[12]


True seers know how to use their elevated vantage point,
clear overview and strong sense of what is important to
put each thing in its right place.

The  spiritually  knowledgeable  become  able  to  stop
obeying  only  the  outer  sense  world’s  unpredictable  in-
fluences  that  direct  their  intentions  this  way  and  that.
Knowledge  lets  them  see  into  the  eternal  nature  of
things; through transforming their inner world, they have
acquired the ability to perceive this eternal nature. The
following thoughts acquire a particular significance for
those who truly know. While acting out of themselves,
such people are aware of acting out of the eternal nature
of things, for they know that it is within them that outer
things express their essence. Therefore, when the know-
ers’  activity  is  directed  by  the  eternal  that  lives  within
them, they are acting in accordance with the eternal order
of the universe. They know that they are no longer sim-
ply being impelled by things but are actively impelling
things  according  to  the  laws  implanted  in  the  things
themselves,  laws  which  have  also  become  the  laws  of
their own being.

This acting from within can only be an ideal to strive
for—reaching the goal still lies in the distant future, but
the seeker of knowledge must have the will to see the way
clearly.  This  is  the will  to  freedom,  because  freedom
means acting from within, and only those who draw their
motivation from the eternal can work from within. Any
being  who  does  not  do  this  works  out  of  reasons  other
than those inherent in things themselves and thus works
contrary to the order of the universe, which will triumph


[13]


in  the  end.  Ultimately,  that  is,  this  being  cannot  get  its
way and cannot become free. Arbitrary individual voli-
tion annihilates itself through the effect of its actions.

Those who can work on their inner life in this way ad-
vance  from  stage  to  stage  in  spiritual  knowledge.  As  a
fruit of their exercises, specific insights into the supersen-
sible  world  become  accessible  to  their  spiritual  percep-
tion. They learn the sense in which facts about this world
are to be taken and confirm them through direct experi-
ence. Having reached this stage, they are approached by
something that can be encountered only along this path.
In a way whose significance can only now become clear
to  them,  “initiation”  is  bestowed  on  them  through  the
great spiritual powers guiding the human race; they be-
come disciples of wisdom. The less we see this initiation
as  consisting  of  any  outward  human  relationship,  the
more accurate the idea we have of it.

It is possible only to hint at what is now happening to
seekers of knowledge. They acquire a new home and be-
come conscious inhabitants of the supersensible world.
From now on, their spiritual insight flows from a higher
source. The light of knowledge no longer shines toward
them from outside; they themselves stand at this light’s
source. They see the riddles that the world presents in a
new light. Now they converse not with things that have
been given form by the spirit but with the formative spirit
itself.  In  moments  of  spiritual  knowledge,  their  life  as


personalities exists only to serve as a conscious metaphor
of the eternal. They can no longer have any doubts about
the  spirit,  because  doubt  is  possible  only  for  someone
whom things mislead with regard to the spirit that pre-
vails within them. And since the disciples of wisdom are
able to converse with the spirit itself, any false form in
which  they  previously  imagined  the  spirit  vanishes.
Imagining the spirit in a false form is superstition, and
initiates are beyond superstition because they know what
the true form of the spirit is.

Freedom from the biases of personality, doubt and su-
perstition  characterize  those  who  have  traveled  up  the
path  of  knowledge  to  the  level  of  discipleship,  but  we
must not confuse this uniting of personalities with the sur-
rounding and all-encompassing spiritual life with the dis-
solution or destruction of personality in a universal spirit.
That is not what happens in true personality development.
Personality  as  such  is  maintained  on  entering  into  rela-
tionship with the spirit world; it is not overcome, but un-
dergoes still higher development. If we need a metaphor
of  what  happens  when  individual  spirits  unite  with  the
universal spirit, we must not imagine different circles that
coincide and become one, but many overlapping circles,
each with a distinct shade of color. Although the circles
overlap, each individual shade maintains its identity with-
in the whole, and no circle loses any of the fullness of its
individual strength.

No further description of this path will be given here.
To the extent that this is possible, it is done in Occult
Science, which is a sequel to this volume.

[14]


What  has  been  said  here  about  the  path  to  spiritual
knowledge can all too easily be misinterpreted as advo-
cating the cultivation of moods and attitudes that entail
turning away from the immediate, joyful and active expe-
rience of life. It must be emphasized that the inner attitude
that renders our soul fit for direct experience of spiritual
reality cannot by extension be required of all the rest of
our life. Those who investigate existence in the spirit can
indeed achieve the soul distance from sensory reality nec-
essary  for  their  research  without  becoming  strangers  to
the world on a general level. On the other hand, we must
also realize that knowledge of the spiritual world that is
acquired either through actually setting out on this path or
through  simply  grasping  spiritual  scientific  truths  with
our unprejudiced and healthy common sense does lead to
higher  moral  standards,  to  an  understanding  of  sensory
existence as it accords with the truth, to a secure confi-
dence in life and to mental health.

The Philosophy of Freedom (1894)

In this early work, Steiner lays down the prerequisites for a path
of  brain-  or  sense-free  thinking.  Anyone  wishing  to  under-
stand  the  epistemological  foundations  that  underlie  Steiner’s
powers of spiritual-scientiﬁc observation should read this work.

How to Know Higher Worlds (1904)

Previously  titled Knowledge  of  the  Higher  Worlds  and  Its
Attainment, this is Rudolf Steiner’s classic account of the mod-
ern path of initiation.

Occult Science (1910)

Originally  conceived  of  as  a  continuation  of Theosophy,  this
work deals with the nature and evolution of humanity and the
cosmos.  It  also  extends  and  deepens  many  of  the  areas  dealt
with  in Theosophy.  It  contains  a  description  of  the  path  of
knowledge,  including  the  “Rose  Cross  meditation,”  which
complements and adds to the descriptions contained in Theoso-
phy and How to Know Higher Worlds.

World.

This work makes available much of the fundamental content of
anthroposophy in the form of meditations.

The Spiritual Guidance of the Individual and Humanity

This small work begins to indicate the role of Christ in human
nature and human evolution.


The Foundations of Esotericism (1905); At the Gates of Spiritual
Science (1906); Theosophy of the Rosicrucian (1907)

These three lecture courses deal with many of the same areas
as Theosophy.  Readers  will  find  much  additional  food  for
thought here, sometimes in more easily digestible form.

The Inﬂuence of Spiritual Beings on Man (1908)

Concerning various facts and beings of the higher worlds and
their connection with humanity.

An Occult Physiology (1911)

Deals in greater detail with the connection of cosmic and spiri-
tual processes to human physiology.

Spiritual Beings in the Heavenly Bodies and in the Kingdoms
of Nature (1912)

This  contains  important  observations  on  the  connection
between  the  various  spiritual  hierarchies  and  the  bodies,  as
well as the I, of the human being.

The Effects of Spiritual Development on the Occult Sheaths
of Man (1913)

Inner development transforms all aspects of the human being.
This lecture course shows the different ways in which various
spiritual practices effect the human constitution.

Chance, Providence, and Necessity (1915)

These  lectures,  above  all,  focus  on  the  etheric  nature  of  the
human being that unites the human being and the cosmos, and
especially on the etheric body as the instrument of perception
for imaginative cognition.

The Human Being in Body, Soul, and Spirit (1922)

Simple  and  direct,  these  lectures  were  given  to  the  workers
constructing the Goetheanum in Dornach.
